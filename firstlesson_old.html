				<h4>LEARNING TO CREATE DESTINY</h4>
				<p></p>
				<p>In this lesson, Mr. Liao-Fan related to his son his own 
				experiences and those of others in changing destiny. He wanted 
				his son to put his best efforts into practicing goodness and 
				ending his incorrect behavior. He also wanted his son to form 
				his destiny and not be bound by it. For in forming destiny, we 
				are not controlled by it; rather we control destiny. Therefore, 
				the lesson of Learning to Create Destiny discusses the 
				principles behind fate and the knowledge necessary to change it. 
				For example, as Pure Land practitioners, if we are able to 
				follow this method, we are assured of attaining a happy and 
				fulfilling life and of being born into the Western Pure Land.</p>
				<h4>Mr. Kong's Accurate Predictions</h4>
				<p></p>
				<p>My father passed away when I was young. My mother persuaded 
				me to learn medicine, instead of studying and passing the 
				imperial examinations, because it would be a good way to support 
				myself while helping others. Perhaps, I could even become famous 
				through my medical skills, thus fulfilling my father's 
				aspiration for me.</p>
				<p>In ancient China, the purpose of studying and passing the 
				imperial examinations was to become a government official. Thus, 
				to stop studying for the examinations was to give up any chance 
				to work in the government. Studying medicine would enable one to 
				have a skill that would provide a good living in addition to 
				helping others.</p>
				<p>It was very important to choose the right career. At that 
				time, teachers did not charge a set fee but accepted whatever 
				was offered. Wealthy families gave more, poor families gave 
				less. As long as the student was sincere in honoring the teacher 
				and respecting the teachings, the amount given was not 
				important. And the same applied to doctors. Their goal was to 
				save lives, to do their very best to make others well. The 
				payment for this was left up to the patient. Both teachers and 
				doctors were dedicated to helping others. Consequently, in 
				ancient China teachers and doctors were highly respected. </p>
				<p>One day, I met an elderly but distinguished looking gentleman 
				at the Compassionate Cloud Temple. He had a long beard and such 
				a look of a sage that I immediately paid my respects to him. He 
				told me, 'You are destined to be a government official. Next 
				year you will attain the rank of Learned First Level Scholar. 
				Why are you not studying for the examination?' I told him the 
				reason.
				</p>
				<p>This segment tells of Mr. Liao-Fan's opportunity to learn how 
				to change his destiny. It described his meeting with an elderly 
				gentleman at the Compassionate Cloud Temple. This gentleman had 
				a very handsome countenance, was tall and had an elegant 
				celestial air. He simply did not look like an ordinary person. 
				Thus, Mr. Liao-Fan naturally paid his respects to him.</p>
				<p>Because the elderly gentleman could foretell the future, he 
				immediately knew that Mr. Liao-Fan should have been studying and 
				needed to do so as soon as possible. In the past, before the 
				government employed someone examinations were held for all the 
				candidates. After passing the first entry examination, the 
				students would then be sent to various county schools to study.</p>
				<p>I asked the elderly gentleman his name and where he was from. 
				He replied, 'My last name is Kong. I came from Yunnan Province. 
				I have inherited a most sacred text on astrology by Shao-Zi. It 
				is called The Imperial Standard of Governing the World. Shao-Zi 
				developed the art of prediction very well. By calculations I am 
				supposed to pass it on to you and teach you how to use it.'</p>
				<p>Shao-Zi was a scholar from the Song Dynasty (approximately 
				one thousand years ago). He was a well-known, highly respected 
				intellectual of his time. The sacred text on astrology is a 
				lengthy book that has been compiled with others into the 
				Complete Library in Four Divisions. (This mammoth collection of 
				fifteen hundred volumes covers four areas: classics and sutras, 
				history, governmental management and literature). </p>
				<p>The content of Shao-Zi's book is completely in accordance 
				with the principles in I Ching, the Book of Changes and predicts 
				the future through mathematical calculations. The predictions in 
				the book covered extensive subjects and areas, including changes 
				in countries and the world. The prosperity and decline of a 
				dynasty, the good fortune and misfortune of an individual could 
				all be completely extrapolated from mathematical calculations. 
				This is a book of profound knowledge based on a precise science 
				and is therefore both logical and believable.&gt;</p>
				<p>Everybody, everything has a set destiny. Buddha Shakyamuni 
				taught us that this is due to the Law of Cause and Effect. As 
				long as we give rise to a cause, be it a thought, a word or an 
				act, a result that is a set destiny will follow. Only when the 
				mind is absent of thought can we can transcend the 
				predestination of the numbers. Why are practitioners with high 
				levels of achievement often able to transcend' Because they are 
				able to achieve deep concentration. And in this deep 
				concentration, their minds do not give rise to any thoughts. 
				Without thoughts, we will not be controlled by the 
				predestination of the numbers. So, we know that as long as we 
				have thoughts, we will be bound by the mathematics. A highly 
				skilled person is able to predict our future in detail through 
				these calculations. The lives of we ordinary beings are 
				predestined. Arhats or other sages with a higher level of 
				spiritual enlightenment, who have already transcended the Six 
				Realms of Reincarnation, are thus able to transcend their fate. 
				Are the heavenly beings in the Form and Formless Heaven realms 
				who have achieved the four meditation states and eight 
				concentration levels able to transcend their fate' Yes, for in 
				their state of deep concentration, the mathematics cannot effect 
				them. But, this ineffectiveness is only temporary. Once they 
				lose their state of deep concentration and again give rise to 
				thoughts they are again bound by the mathematics. And this is 
				why they have never been able to permanently transcend the Six 
				Realms of Reincarnation.</p>
				<p>If the strength of their concentration enabled them to 
				transcend the Six Realms and advance to the ninth concentration 
				level to become a non-regressive Arhat, then they would no 
				longer be bound by the mathematics. Once we understand these 
				principles and know that everything is predestined, we will look 
				at this world with a nondiscriminatory mind. We will neither be 
				pleased with favorable circumstances nor be displeased with 
				unfavorable circumstances because everything is predestined.</p>
				<p>Therefore, I invited Mr. Kong to my home and asked my mother 
				about him. My mother asked me to treat him very well. We then 
				tested Mr. Kong's ability at prediction. He was always correct 
				whether it was for big events or for small everyday matters. 
				Therefore, I became convinced of what he had said about my 
				destiny and again began to think of studying for the 
				examinations. I consulted with my cousin Chen Shen. He 
				recommended a teacher Mr. Hai-Gu Yu, who was teaching at the 
				home of a friend, Mr. You-Fu Shen. I thus became his student.</p> 
				<p>Mr. Liao-Fan invited Mr. Kong to his house and being a filial 
				son told his mother about him. His mother asked him to take good 
				care of Mr. Kong and to test his authenticity. When someone 
				tells us something, we need to check its validity before 
				believing it. Mr. Liao-Fan did so and found Mr. Kong&#8217;s 
				predictions to be accurate. Thus, he was convinced and naturally 
				took Mr. Kong&#8217;s advice. </p>
				<p>In the past, schools were not common like they are today. 
				Before the Qing Dynasty, the last dynasty in China, instructions 
				took place at a private home school. Usually there was only one 
				teacher instructing twenty to thirty students. There were no 
				high schools, only public universities. Students studied very 
				hard with a private tutor to be able to sit for the examination 
				to attend a government-managed university. </p>
				<p>At this time, Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s cousin had a friend named Hai-Gu 
				Yu who was teaching at You-Fu Shen&#8217;s home. Perhaps, Mr. Shen was 
				a wealthy individual who had several empty rooms in his house to 
				be used as classrooms and who employed teachers to instruct his 
				children as well as those of relatives and friends. So, Mr. 
				Liao-Fan became a pupil of Mr. Yu and began his studies to 
				prepare for the examination. </p>
				<p>Mr. Kong then did some more calculations for me. He told me 
				that as a scholar, I would place fourteenth in the county 
				examination, seventy-first in the regional examination and ninth 
				in the provincial examination. The following year, at the three 
				examination places I placed exactly as Mr. Kong had predicted. </p>
				<p>Mr. Kong predicted Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s immediate destiny and told 
				him that he would rise through several stages of examinations to 
				become a scholar. Therefore, whether it was passing or failing 
				an examination or what rank he would attain, everything was 
				predestined. Thus, the results of the examinations in the second 
				year were exactly as predicted. So again, everything was as 
				expected. </p>
				<p>I then asked him to make predictions for my entire life. Mr. 
				Kong&#8217;s calculations showed that I would pass such and such a 
				test in such and such a year, the year that I would become a 
				civil scholar (equivalent to a high school student), and the 
				year that I would receive a promotion to become an imperial 
				scholar (equivalent to a university student). And lastly, I 
				would be appointed as magistrate in Sichuan Province. 
				</p>
				<p>After holding that position for three and a half years, I 
				would retire and return home. I would die at the age of 
				fifty-three, on August 14th around the hours of one to three am. 
				Unfortunately, I would not have a son. I recorded everything 
				that he said and carefully set it aside. </p>
				<p>At that time in history, the government provided high school 
				and university students with an allowance. Living expenses were 
				supplemented by rice. Similar to a food ration, excessive rice 
				could be sold. Every region had a set number of positions 
				available. Only when there was a vacancy, could the position be 
				filled. </p>
				<p>From Mr. Kong's predictions for Mr. Liao-Fan, we can see that 
				everything is destined. Everyday, every month, when and how we 
				will live, when and how we will die, all is destined. No matter 
				how we might try to scheme or plot, ordinary people cannot 
				escape their destiny. 
				<br />
				After that, the outcome of every examination turned out exactly 
				as predicted. Mr. Kong had also predicted that I would only be 
				promoted after receiving a ration of ninety-one dan and five dou 
				of rice. However, I had received only seventy dan of rice when 
				the Commissioner of Education, Mr. Tu, recommended me for a 
				promotion. I secretly began to doubt Mr. Kong&#8217;s predictions. 
				Nevertheless, the prediction turned out to be correct after all, 
				because Mr. Tu&#8217;s replacement turned down the promotion. </p>
				<p>It was not until some years later that a new Education 
				Commissioner, Mr. Yin reviewed my old examination papers and 
				exclaimed, &#8220;These five essays are as well written as reports to 
				the Emperor. How can we bury the talents of such a great 
				scholar&#8221;. </p>
				<p>When Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s salary reached seventy dan of rice, Mr. 
				Tu approved his promotion. Mr. Liao-Fan started to doubt the 
				predictions. However, after his approval either by promotion or 
				transfer to another position, there was a substitute in Mr. Tu&#8217;s 
				place. And this person, not agreeing with Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s 
				promotion overruled it. </p>
				<p>It was a few years later that an official, Mr. Yin, went 
				through the papers that had failed the examination. These papers 
				were kept and reread occasionally in the hope of finding 
				overlooked talent. He read Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s papers and was very 
				impressed with them. He felt they were as well written as 
				official reports to the emperor. These reports were similar to 
				recommendations from government officials to the emperor, to be 
				accepted or rejected by the court. It is thus evident that Mr. 
				Liao-Fan was very knowledgeable and that his papers were 
				extremely well written. </p>
				<p>The Commissioner wanted the magistrate to issue an order for 
				me to become a candidate for &#8220;Imperial Scholar&#8221; under his 
				authority. After undergoing this eventful promotion, my 
				calculations showed that I had received exactly ninety-one dan 
				and five dou of rice. From then on, I deeply believed that 
				promotion or demotion, wealth or poverty all came about in due 
				time and that even the length of one&#8217;s life is prearranged. I 
				began to view everything in a detached manner and ceased to seek 
				gain or profit. </p>
				<p>Imperial students had all of their expenses paid by the 
				government but were expected to work for the government once 
				their schooling was completed. From this incident, we can see 
				that Mr. Tu was not an ordinary person. He had wanted to promote 
				Mr. Liao-Fan the instant he read his examination papers. 
				However, his replacement overruled the promotion, two people 
				with different opinions. Mr. Liao-Fan was obviously very 
				talented. But although we may be very talented, we still need 
				the appropriate conditions. Whether fate, time or cause and 
				condition, everything is destined. Mr. Liao-Fan had to wait 
				until another government official read his papers for the proper 
				conditions to mature in order to receive his promotion. </p>
				<p>From then on, Mr. Liao-Fan was awakened and truly understood. 
				Our good or bad fortune, good or bad luck, wealth or poverty; 
				everything is predestined. Ordinary people cannot change 
				destiny. If we are not supposed to have something, no amount of 
				trying to get it will succeed for long. But, if we are supposed 
				to have it, we will naturally receive it. Understanding this, 
				Mr. Liao-Fan no longer had any thoughts of demand, any thoughts 
				of gain or loss. His mind was truly at peace. </p>
				<p>We can say that at this point, as an ordinary person, he was 
				perfect. Today, people do not even meet this standard of being 
				ordinary. Why' Our minds are not pure and we constantly have 
				wandering thoughts. On the other hand, Mr. Liao-Fan did not have 
				wandering thoughts since he already knew everything that was 
				going to happen in his life. </p>
				<p>Ancient sages said that, &#8220;a person of noble character and 
				integrity is happy to be a noble person, but it is not worth the 
				effort for a bad person to be bad&#8221;. Why' Because a wise and 
				virtuous person knows that &#8220;One sip or one bite, everything is 
				destined.&#8221; It is not worth the effort to be bad risking all in 
				seeking self-satisfaction. Everything he or she has gained 
				through scheming and plotting was something they were already 
				meant to have. Thus, it is not worth the effort to use improper 
				means to obtain it and then to suffer the consequences. Ordinary 
				people are bound by their fate. At this time in his life, Mr. 
				Liao-Fan only knew about destiny. He did not yet know that there 
				was a variable, that destiny could be changed. </p>
				<p>By practicing in accordance with true principles and methods, 
				we can change our destinies. We will then be able to attain 
				whatever we wish, as we ourselves become the masters of our own 
				fates. In order to attain wealth we practice the giving of 
				wealth. To attain intelligence and wisdom we practice the giving 
				of teachings. To attain long lives and well-being we practice 
				the giving of fearlessness. These are the correct ways to change 
				our destiny. By following the correct principles and methods, we 
				can attain whatever we want, even perfect complete enlightenment 
				much less small worldly enjoyments and happiness. </p>
				<p>After being selected as an imperial scholar, I was to attend 
				the University at Beijing. During my yearlong stay in the 
				capital, my interest in meditation grew and I often sat 
				silently, without giving rise to a single thought. I lost 
				interest in books and did not study at all. </p>
				<p>Mr. Liao-Fan was now practicing meditation everyday in 
				Beijing. From this, we can see how peaceful and quiet his mind 
				had become. When the mind is quiet and at peace, wisdom will 
				naturally arise. The wisdom of most people is non-functional 
				because their minds are not pure. Mr. Liao-Fan was able to 
				remain calm and serene because knowing his entire destiny. He 
				knew that it was useless to even think about it. Without 
				wandering thoughts, his mind naturally became settled. 
				</p>
				<h4>Master Yun-Gu&#8217;s Advice on Changing Destiny</h4>
				<br /> <br />
				<h5>The Principle of Changing Destiny</h5>
				<br/>
				<p>&nbsp;The following year I went to Nanjing. Before I was to enter 
				the National University at Nanjing, I paid a visit to Master 
				Yun-Gu, a venerable Zen Master at Qixia Mountain. We sat in 
				meditation face to face in the Zen hall for three days and three 
				nights without sleep. </p>
				<p>Master Yun-Gu said, &#8220;The reason why 
				ordinary people cannot become sages is because they have too 
				many wandering thoughts running through their minds. In our 
				three-day meditation, I have not observed a single thought arise 
				in you. Why'&#8221; </p>
				<p>I replied that Mr. Kong had clearly predicted the 
				entire outcome of my life. I had seen that the time of life, 
				death, promotion and failure are all predestined. There was no 
				use or need for me to think about it or to desire anything. The 
				master smiled and replied, &#8220;I thought you were someone of 
				remarkable capabilities! Now I realize you are just an average, 
				ordinary person&#8221;! </p>
				<p>Master Yun-Gu, was a well-known great Zen 
				Master. Mr. Liao-Fan went to Qixia Mountain to visit him. They 
				sat face to face in the meditation hall for three days. They 
				neither slept nor became tired. Why' Because they did not have 
				any wandering thoughts and thus they were able to conserve all 
				of their energy. Master Yun-Gu thought him to be extremely young 
				to achieve this difficult and rare level of cultivation. 
				</p>
				<p>Ordinary people are unable to become Arhats or attain higher 
				levels of achievement because they have too many wandering 
				thoughts. The Flower Adornment Sutra tells us that, &#8220;All 
				sentient beings have the same wisdom and virtuous capabilities 
				as the Buddha but because of wandering thoughts and attachments, 
				are unable to uncover them&#8221;. So, the root cause of not being 
				able to become a sage is wandering thoughts. </p>
				<p>Feeling confused by 
				what Master Yun-Gu said, I asked him to explain. He told me that 
				an ordinary person&#8217;s mind is forever occupied by wandering and 
				imaginary thoughts, so naturally their life is bound by chi, the 
				energy of yin and yang as well as destiny. We cannot deny the 
				fact that it exists, but only ordinary people are bound by it. 
				Destiny cannot bind those who cultivate great kindness. </p>
				<p>Nor can 
				destiny bind those who have committed flagrant bad deeds. He 
				told me that for the past twenty years, I had lived my life just 
				as Mr. Kong had predicted and had done nothing to change it. 
				Instead, I became bound by destiny. If I was not considered an 
				ordinary person, who was. </p>
				<p>Taken aback, I asked Master Yun-Gu if 
				it was true that we can change our destiny. The Master answered, 
				&#8220;We create our own destiny. We seek our own good fortune. It is 
				the true teaching and says so in the Book of Songs and the Book 
				of History&#8221;. </p>
				<p>Master Yun-Gu explained that if one has not yet 
				attained the state where there is no single wandering thought 
				then one is still bound by destiny, is still at the mercy of 
				fate. Why' If a person were to reach the state of no thought 
				then he or she would transcend the control of fate. Did Mr. 
				Liao-Fan reach this state of no thought' No! He simply did not 
				wish to think about anything, realizing the futility of doing 
				so. But he still had wandering thoughts. Still thought, &#8220;I do 
				not need to think about anything. My whole destiny has been 
				foretold thus I clearly know my whole life&#8221;. Having yet to reach 
				the state of no thought, we are still bound by our fate. 
				</p>
				<p>Profound deep concentration is not achievable by average people 
				in our world. When the Zen Patriarch Huang Bi, was in this state 
				of deep concentration he was able to break through the 
				dimensions of time and space. At this point, the past, present 
				and future all become one entirety in which everything is 
				visible without the slightest error. Using mathematics to deduce 
				the future is achievable by ordinary people in this world. To be 
				able to actually see the past, present and future is not. It 
				requires deep concentration to reach the state of being able to 
				see the future. This is only achievable by beings higher than 
				the third stage of sagehood in Theravada Buddhism. </p>
				<p>Master Yun-Gu 
				told Mr. Liao-Fan that only ordinary people are bound by 
				destiny. However, destiny cannot control those who have 
				accomplished numerous exemplary deeds. Neither can it control 
				those who have committed excessive flagrant offenses. Mr. 
				Liao-Fan had been bound by Mr. Kong&#8217;s predictions for twenty 
				years. He had done nothing to change them and so he was indeed 
				an ordinary person. A person of great virtue also has a set 
				destiny but he or she has changed it. The same applies to those 
				who have committed excessive offenses for they too will have 
				changed their destiny. We can see that Mr. Liao-Fan did not 
				cultivate either extremely good or bad deeds since his life 
				accorded so completely with what had been predicted. </p>
				<p>Can fate be 
				changed' Can we escape it' Yes. To &#8220;escape&#8221; is to transcend. 
				There are variables in the set numbers and the set numbers were 
				what Mr. Kong had predicted. The variables are within our 
				control, but this is either what Mr. Kong did not know or could 
				not calculate. We can create our destiny. We can seek our own 
				good fortune.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;There are variables within the set numbers and 
				this is what Mr. Liao-Fan did not know about. Did Zen Master 
				Yun-Gu agree there were set numbers' Yes. &quot;Before a person 
				achieves the state of no thought, he or she is bound by 
				destiny&quot;. Master Yun-Gu completely accepted the concept of 
				predestination. However, we can change our own destiny and thus 
				we create it. Buddhism is not about predestination. It is about 
				recreating destiny. But, we can only depend on ourselves to do 
				this, to become awakened. Nobody else can change our destiny for 
				us. </p>
				<p>&#8220;Destiny is created by ourselves,&#8221; and &#8220;We seek our own good 
				fortune&#8221;. Since Mr. Liao-Fan was an intellectual, he knew much 
				about the teachings of Confucius and so the master cited 
				principles from the Book of Songs and the Book of History to 
				enlighten him. Master Yun-Gu understood these teachings and 
				confirmed them to be important and true. </p>
				<p>In the Buddhist 
				teachings, it is written that if we wish for and seek wealth, 
				position, a son, a daughter, long life, we can attain them. 
				Since lying is one of the greatest offenses in the Buddha's 
				teachings, we can be assured that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have 
				no reason to deceive us. In Buddhism, it said that, &#8220;In seeking 
				wealth, one will attain wealth. In seeking children, one will 
				attain children&#8221;. Even if we were not meant to have any children 
				in this life, upon practicing good deeds we can have a child. 
				&#8220;In seeking long life, one will attain long life&#8221;. Mr. Liao-Fan 
				was only meant to have a short life, was supposed to die at 
				fifty-three. By cultivating according to the teachings whatever 
				we seek, we will attain. Buddhism encourages us to create our 
				own destinies rather than be constrained by them. </p>
				<p>Living Buddha 
				Master Zhang Jia said that, &#8220;In Buddhism, all our sincere pleas 
				shall be answered&#8221;. He elaborated further. Some people are 
				unable to get what they want. Why' They did not accord with the 
				teachings. If we understand the principles and methods, and have 
				sought something in accordance with the teachings, then we are 
				assured of receiving a response to our request. If we do not 
				receive the desired response after having accorded with the 
				teachings, it is due to our karmic obstacles. </p>
				<p>Once we have 
				successfully eradicated these karmic obstacles, we will be able 
				to gain the desired results. As Master Zhang Jia said, there is 
				nothing we cannot receive once we seek it properly. Once we 
				understand the fundamental principles, we will understand that 
				&quot;everything in this world and beyond arises from our minds and 
				changes due to our perceptions&quot;. If we seek to become Buddhas, 
				we will become Buddhas. If we seek to become heavenly beings, we 
				will become heavenly beings. Everything accords with the mind.&quot; 
				The Flower Adornment Sutra tells us that, &#8220;We should observe the 
				nature of the Dharma Realm as everything is created by the 
				mind&#8221;. Therefore, the way of seeking is to accord with the 
				principle that everything arises from our mind, is changed by 
				our perception, our consciousness. </p>
				<p>A most suitable and perfect 
				method is the teachings of the Buddha. If we were to seek youth, 
				health, eternal life in accordance with these teachings, can we 
				attain them' Certainly! Master Yun-Gu only taught Mr. Liao-Fan 
				some of the knowledge. Because Mr. Liao-Fan was not very 
				ambitious and only sought worldly fame, wealth and prestige, the 
				master only taught him this limited part. </p>
				<p>The master told him 
				that lying is one of the worst offenses in Buddhism. There are 
				four fundamental precepts or rules: no killing, stealing, lying 
				or sexual misconduct. Since, no lying is one of the fundamental 
				precepts, how could the Buddha lie, how could he deceive us' 
				Thus, it is the truth when the master told him that whether 
				seeking children, wealth or long life, all could be obtained. As 
				Mr. Liao-Fan had strictly practiced by following the master&#8217;s 
				guidance, he obtained what he sought. </p>
				<p>I then said I had heard 
				that Mencius once said &#8220;Whatever is sought can be attained. The 
				seeking is in ourselves&#8221;. This refers to inner qualities such as 
				virtue, responsibility and kindness. These are all qualities we 
				can work toward. However, when it comes to outside factors such 
				as wealth, fame and prestige, how can we seek to attain them' 
				The Master replied that Mencius was correct, but that I had 
				misinterpreted his meaning. </p>
				<p>Enhancing our inner qualities to 
				become sages and virtuous people is within our control. But how 
				do we seek fame, wealth and prestige' These are external 
				commodities and are also attainable. Whatever we do not have, 
				such as fame or wealth, we can attain by seeking. So it would 
				seem to be destined. Because if we are not destined to have 
				something how could we seek it' This follows most people&#8217;s 
				understanding of destiny, a constant in predestination. The 
				constant is the cause that we have created in our past lives and 
				the result that we should receive in this life. We do not yet 
				know that there are variables within the constants, that the 
				results will change with the addition of variables. Indeed fame, 
				wealth, and prestige are attainable by us. </p>
				<p>Master Yun-Gu said 
				that Master Hui-Neng, the Sixth Patriarch of the Zen School 
				taught &#8220;All the fields of merit are within one&#8217;s own heart. If 
				one seeks from the true mind within, one can be in touch with 
				all one wishes for&quot;. By seeking inside ourselves, we will not 
				only attain the inner qualities of virtue, responsibility and 
				kindness, but we can also attain wealth, fame and prestige. To 
				be able to attain both on the inside and on the outside is 
				beneficial to our reward. </p>
				<p>Since ancient times in China, The 
				Platform Sutra, the Diamond Sutra and the Surangama Sutra have 
				been acknowledged as eminent literary works. The eloquent 
				Platform Sutra was written by a Chinese Patriarch, thus to the 
				Chinese it is particularly important. We cannot think of it as 
				solely a sutra of the Zen School. It is an overview of Buddhism 
				as a whole and also could be said to be Master Hui-Neng&#8217;s report 
				of what he had learned through his study and practice. </p>
				<p>Whether 
				attaining something outside of ourselves such as material 
				objects or inside ourselves such as virtues, we still need to 
				seek from inside, from the mind, not from the outside. It would 
				be incorrect to seek from the outside. Why' The outside factor 
				is a constant so it does not change. The mind is a variable so 
				it is not constant, it changes. </p>
				<p>For twenty years, Mr. Liao-Fan 
				did not have wandering thoughts, thus, his mind could be 
				considered as having been pure. Not knowing of the variables, 
				his mind accorded completely with the constants. Thus, the 
				twenty years of his life were exactly as Mr. Kong had predicted, 
				everything occurred without the slightest deviation. This was 
				because he did not understand the principle of variables. </p>
				<p>Master 
				Yun-Gu taught the principle that &#8220;the seeking is in ourselves&#8221;. 
				virtue, morality, kindness and responsibility are on the inside, 
				they are the cultivation of virtuous conduct. Fame, wealth and 
				prestige are on the outside, they are the enjoyments in life. To 
				be able to receive both kinds of benefits is invaluable. As is 
				said in the Flower Adornment Sutra, &#8220;Not to be hindered in the 
				matter of existing things or reality principles&#8221;, is the 
				ultimate and perfect enjoyment, the great perfection of both the 
				inside and the outside. It is when everything is going as we 
				wish. It is when we are satisfied with everything. It is to be 
				liberated. It is to do all that is benevolent, all that is noble 
				as we wish. If we cannot attain such wonderful results then no 
				one would want to practice Buddhism. </p>
				<p>Buddhism is neither 
				negative nor passive, it is eminently practical. Nowadays, there 
				is nothing more practical than the practice of Buddhism for it 
				addresses reality, addresses something truly attainable. It is 
				crucial that we understand the importance of Buddhism to derive 
				the benefits from it. The truth is that people have 
				misunderstood Buddhism and thus have missed these benefits. If 
				we are able to personally experience them then we will know that 
				of all teachings, Buddhism is a most remarkable and beneficial 
				education. It is definitely not outdated and is as appropriate 
				now as it was three thousand years ago. It is fitting for all 
				people whether in the east or in the west. </p>
				<p>Master Yun-Gu then 
				told me that if one cannot reflect inside one&#8217;s own heart but 
				instead blindly seeks fame, fortune and long life from outside 
				sources, although one may pursue them by using intelligence, one 
				can only attain at most what destiny had entitled one to. To do 
				otherwise, one might lose both inner purity and what one was 
				predestined to have. Then this seeking will have been in vain.				</p>
				<p>This is pertinent for our world today. Can everyone attain what 
				  they are seeking' No. If we attain something it is because we 
				  were destined to have it. Only when we receive what we were not 
				  destined to have, can it be said that we have gained what we 
				  sought. It does not count when we receive what we were supposed 
				  to have for we would have attained it without having 
				  intentionally sought it. </p>
				<p>For example, someone tells us that 
				  investing in the stock market is very profitable because they 
				  made millions of dollars a year in it. This person simply gained 
				  what he or she was supposed to gain. Others who are not destined 
				  to make money will simply lose it in the stock market. Not 
				  everyone profits from it. If every investor profits, then who 
				  loses' Likewise, money won from gambling is something the 
				  gambler was meant to have. Even the thief was meant to have what 
				  was stolen. If it had not been destined, then he would not have 
				  been successful in stealing it. </p>
				<p>The ancients understood this, 
				  thus they said that, &#8220;A person of noble character and integrity 
				  is happy to be a noble person, but it is not worth the effort 
				  for a bad person to be bad&#8221;. Why' They will not be able to 
				  escape destiny, the constant. If we could just really understand 
				  the principles then all of us would be content with what we 
				  have. In this way, we will enjoy a fulfilling life, society will 
				  be stable, the world will be peaceful and there will be no more 
				  conflicts, no more wars. </p>
				<p>Buddhism teaches us to seek for 
				  something not destined in our lives, not within the constant. 
				  What we are able to attain from seeking comes from the variable. 
				  How do we seek' From inside. This is crucial in our world today. 
				  Today, we are unable to seek awakening and to develop great 
				  virtue from the inside. Why' We do not yet understand. We seek 
				  from the outside. We plan and scheme everyday. But in seeking, 
				  we need to follow the right path. For even if we have the 
				  method, the plan, the means then what' In attaining, we merely 
				  attained what we were supposed to attain. Very simple. If we 
				  were not supposed to have it, we would not get it. All that we 
				  have attained was destined, was the constant. Mr. Liao-Fan 
				  understood there was a constant so he did not worry, he did not 
				  use various improper ways to seek. He knew his own destiny. He 
				  knew that to give rise to wandering thoughts, or to use whatever 
				  means possible was doomed to fail if it was not supposed to be.				  </p>
				<p>&#8220;To be at a loss, inside and outside&#8221;. What is the inside' The 
				  impure mind. How would we not give rise to afflictions, when our 
				  seeking on the outside is frustrated' For twenty years Mr. 
				  Liao-Fan conformed to Mr. Kong's predictions. Consequently, he 
				  did not lose the inside, he lost the outside. Because he did not 
				  think of anything, did not seek anything from the inside but 
				  maintained a state of contentment and purity of mind. Everything 
				  on the outside is controlled by fate. Everything on the inside 
				  is controlled by us. </p>
				<p>Average people who fought tooth and nail to 
				  seek things from the outside would find that their knowledge and 
				  experience were incomparable to those of Mr. Liao-Fan. He had 
				  achieved perfect peace of mind. Ordinary people end up with 
				  afflicted and unsettled minds. Whatever they attained was 
				  something they were destined to have, thus they lost both inside 
				  and outside. For if one does not gain, one loses, thus ending up 
				  worse off than before. And then there is no benefit at all. </p>

                  <br />
                  <br />
				<h5>A. To Acknowledge our Faults </h5>
                <br />
             	<p>Master 
				  Yun-Gu then asked what were Mr. Kong&#8217;s predictions regarding my 
				  entire life. I honestly told him the whole story. He then asked 
				  if I felt that I deserved imperial appointments or a son. I 
				  reflected upon my previous deeds and attitudes in the past for a 
				  long time. Then I answered him that no, I did not feel that I 
				  deserved an imperial appointment or a son. Those who received 
				  imperial appointments all had the appearance of good fortune and 
				  I did not. I did not work towards accumulating virtues to build 
				  up my good fortune, either. I was very impatient and 
				  narrow-minded. Sometimes, I would show off my intelligence and 
				  talent in putting down others. I also behaved arbitrarily and 
				  spoke without any sense of restraint. These were all signs of 
				  scant good fortune and virtue. How could I possibly receive an 
				  imperial appointment? </p>
             	<p>Master Yun-Gu did not directly answer the 
             	  question, rather he asked Mr. Liao-Fan a question to teach him 
             	  to reflect within to find the root cause of his faults and 
             	  suffering, to determine whether he deserved an imperial 
             	  appointment or not. Whether he deserved to have a son. The 
             	  discussion between Master Yun-Gu and Mr. Liao-Fan did not only 
             	  include these two questions, but to Mr. Liao-Fan these two were 
             	  the most important and the ones he was most concerned about. 
             	  Thus, there was no need to mention the rest. Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  thought for a long time about what Master Yun-Gu had asked. He 
             	  then honestly answered that no, he deserved neither an imperial 
             	  appointment nor a son. </p>
             	<p>On his honesty, Mr. Xi-Yin Yu in his 
             	  commentary on Liao-Fan&#8217;s Four Lessons stated, &#8220;Honesty is the 
             	  foundation in developing virtue. If a person hides or glosses 
             	  over his or her faults or covers up mistakes, how can his or her 
             	  future be promising'&#8221; When we are honest and encounter 
             	  benevolent teachers, they will be protective and guide us on the 
             	  right path. On the other hand, if we were dishonest and 
             	  arrogant, they will smile but they will not seriously teach us.             	  </p>
             	<p>Mr. Liao-Fan deeply regretted his faults and this became the key 
             	  to changing his destiny. He told Master Yun-Gu that he did not 
             	  deserve an imperial appointment because he did not have the 
             	  appearance of good fortune. It is necessary for government 
             	  officials to have good fortune or else the citizens will suffer. 
             	  When they do have good fortune, people will benefit. Upon 
             	  examination of ancient social systems, we see that educated and 
             	  logical people did not have disputes. Also, some emperors were 
             	  very wise and enlightened. </p>
             	<p>For example, Tai Zong of the Tang 
             	  Dynasty (over one thousand years ago) was extremely learned and 
             	  broad-minded and was thus admired by the people. He said, &#8220;What 
             	  is so good about being an emperor' To be one is a grave 
             	  responsibility. If you want to be one you can take my place&#8221;. He 
             	  did not personally enjoy being an emperor, did not intimidate 
             	  others, but served the people, created happiness for them and 
             	  found capable scholars to work on behalf of the empire. </p>
             	<p>All 
             	  caring government officials have the appearance or sign of good 
             	  fortune. Mr. Liao-Fan at this time in his life had very little 
             	  good fortune and was unable or unwilling to cultivate any. Thus, 
             	  he did not even have the appearance of a government official. So 
             	  at this time he was not adequate to serve and to lead. </p>
             	<p>Next Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan explained that he was very impatient, intolerant and 
             	  undisciplined, three serious faults. Being impatient and 
             	  bad-tempered gives us the appearance of scant good fortune. A 
             	  narrow-minded person is unable to tolerate others. These bad 
             	  qualities would render a person unable to properly choose and 
             	  supervise or lead people, unable to justly serve others. </p>
             	<p>Also, 
             	  he frankly admitted that he was self-indulgent and liked to show 
             	  off his intelligence. He did whatever he wanted. This is also 
             	  something not readily endured by others. He was indiscreet and 
             	  irresponsible in his speech and lacked consideration for others. 
             	  All these faults bring us misfortune rather than good fortune.             	  </p>
             	<p>People who truly have good fortune are kind-hearted and honest, 
             	  broad-minded and tolerant of others. They are calm and dignified 
             	  in speech and manner. Confucius said, &#8220;One does not inspire 
             	  respect when one is not dignified&#8221;. Only with dignity and the 
             	  ability to inspire respect are we able to convince people, to 
             	  effectively interact with them. Mr. Liao-Fan admitted that when 
             	  he was young, he simply was not calm and dignified enough and 
             	  cited this as one of the reasons that he lacked good fortune and 
             	  was thus undeserving of an imperial appointment. </p>
             	<p>There is an old 
             	  saying, &#8220;Life springs from the dirt of the earth. Clear water 
             	  often harbors no fish&#8221;. The first reason why I felt that I did 
             	  not deserve a son was that I was overly attached to cleanliness. 
             	  The second reason was that harmony is the cultivator of all 
             	  life. But I was quick tempered and easily became angry. The 
             	  third reason was based on the principle that loving-kindness is 
             	  the root of reproduction and harshness is the root of sterility. 
             	  I overly guarded my own reputation and could not sacrifice 
             	  anything for the sake of others. </p>
             	<p>The fourth reason was that I 
             	  talked too much, which wasted a lot of chi or energy. The fifth 
             	  reason was that I indulged in drinking. The sixth reason that I 
             	  did not have a son was my habit of staying up nights, not 
             	  knowing how to conserve my energy. Aside from these, I had many 
             	  other faults that were too numerous to mention.</p>
             	<p> A proverb tells 
             	  us that when the ground is not clean, it will grow things. But, 
             	  when the water is too clear, it will have no fish. Why' Fish 
             	  know that, in clear water, fishermen will easily catch them. So, 
             	  they do not swim in clear water. It could also be said that when 
             	  the ground is too clean, without dirt, nothing could grow. </p>
             	<p>Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan had an exaggerated fear of things not being clean. 
             	  Being clean and neat is a good quality, however to be overly so 
             	  becomes a problem, an obsession. It is not good to be unable to 
             	  tolerate even the slightest bit of grime. This is the first 
             	  reason he did not deserve a son. </p>
             	<p>Harmony can help a family to 
             	  prosper. As is said, &#8220;Friendliness is conducive to wealth&#8221;. The 
             	  fact that Mr. Liao-Fan is not wealthy is partially due to his 
             	  bad temper. Since he was not wealthy, this placed his family in 
             	  a precarious financial situation. Also, he often became angry at 
             	  the least provocation. He could not tolerate anything 
             	  displeasing. To behave in this manner results in a lack of good 
             	  fortune and is the second reason he did not deserve a son.             	  </p>
             	<p>Loving-kindness is benevolence and consideration for others. Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan understood these principles, but was unable to achieve 
             	  them. Why' Because he was a very unkind person. In other words, 
             	  he overvalued his reputation and was unwilling to help others, 
             	  which is another reason why he did not deserve a son. The fourth 
             	  reason is that he talked too much, which frankly wasted a lot of 
             	  energy. </p>
             	<p>From his introspection, Mr. Liao-Fan came up with six 
             	  major reasons why he did not have children, the first three, 
             	  being overly concerned with cleanliness, being quick tempered 
             	  and lacking loving-kindness were from the aspect of intention, 
             	  the mind. The next three, talking too much, drinking and staying 
             	  up all night were from the aspect of behavior, the body. He 
             	  liked to talk and criticize others. He indulged in gossip about 
             	  other&#8217;s faults and liked winning arguments with others. These 
             	  harm the body and exhaust our energy. He also liked to drink 
             	  excessively which harms the mind and exhausts our spirit. Last, 
             	  he said he did not deserve a son because he spent the night 
             	  chatting with friends, drinking, having a good time and not 
             	  bothering to take good care of his health. </p>
             	<p>By realizing that he 
             	  had so many bad habits and faults, Mr. Liao-Fan honestly 
             	  admitted and felt remorse for all his erroneous behavior. To 
             	  acknowledge all his offenses without concealing any secrets is 
             	  to &#8220;Regret and eradicate one&#8217;s karmic obstacles&#8221;. This must be 
             	  done sincerely to be effective. Awakening is achieved when we 
             	  are able to identify our faults. Cultivation is accomplished 
             	  when we have realized these erroneous ways and rectified them. 
             	  Since most people are not yet aware of their faults, they are 
             	  not yet truly cultivating. Cultivation is to correct our own 
             	  erroneous ways, to correct our deviated thoughts and behavior. 
             	  Therefore, the first step in correcting our false ways is to 
             	  recognize them and to be able to turn over to a new leaf. Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan was so amazing, because once Master Yun-Gu questioned 
             	  him, he was able to carefully and completely consider, to 
             	  discover all his faults one by one and this is the basic cause 
             	  of how he was able to change his destiny from that point on.</p>
             	<p> How 
             	  was he able to change his destiny? And why are we unable to do 
             	  so' We are completely ignorant of our own faults. So, we are 
             	  unable to correct them. He was able to reflect within, to 
             	  uncover and change each of his faults one by one. In so doing, 
             	  he attained what he sought; on the inside, virtuous and caring 
             	  conduct and on the outside, wealth and children. Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  did not seek from the outside, we did not see him bowing and 
             	  burning incense in front of Great Compassion Bodhisattva, 
             	  seeking children, fame, wealth and prestige. But nowadays, 
             	  people seek by merely going through the formalities of blindly 
             	  worshiping. They do not understand the principles. They seek 
             	  what they desire, but this is the wrong way to do so. They will 
             	  not be able to attain what they seek in this way. </p>
             	<p>From day to 
             	  night we see countless people going to temples, burning candles 
             	  and incense while asking for wealth and children, attaining what 
             	  their destiny had already entitled them to have what they would 
             	  have attained without having to plead for them. In their 
             	  ignorance, they think what they received was granted by the 
             	  grace of deities. Buddhist practitioners need to understand the 
             	  truth, to seek what we desire in accordance with the teachings. 
             	  As Master Yun-Gu said, &#8220;to gain both on the inside and on the 
             	  outside&#8221;. In this way, there is nothing that we cannot attain.             	  </p>
             	<p>Master Yun-Gu then said, &#8220;According to you then, there are many 
             	  things in life you do not deserve, not only fame and a son! 
             	  Those who have millions of dollars in this life must have 
             	  cultivated the good fortune worthy of that amount in the past. 
             	  Those who have thousands of dollars must also have good fortune, 
             	  which is worthy of generating that sum. Those, who die of 
             	  starvation were in fact were meant to die in that manner. The 
             	  karmic result today is simply the fruit of their deeds. Heavenly 
             	  beings do not have any intentions for us&#8221;. </p>
             	<p>This advice from 
             	  Master Yun-Gu is most important and must not be regarded as mere 
             	  superstition! For to do so is to be deluded and thus to be 
             	  unable to believe the words of sages, to believe the true 
             	  reality. Master Yun-Gu taught Mr. Liao-Fan to honestly reflect 
             	  within and to be self-critical. This enabled him to recognize 
             	  his many faults. Thus, the greatest virtuous deed is for us to 
             	  recognize and change our erroneous ways. </p>
             	<p>Making offerings to 
             	  infinite sages is a great virtuous deed. But, we learn from the 
             	  Infinite Life Sutra that it is even better to turn back from 
             	  delusion and to earnestly and diligently cultivate. To do so is 
             	  to turn over a new leaf, what ancient sages described as the 
             	  great virtue of regretting and reforming. </p>
             	<p>Master Yun-Gu told Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan, that apparently he felt there were many things in life 
             	  that he did not deserve not only a son or an imperial 
             	  appointment. Attaining a high grade in the examinations and the 
             	  resultant imperial appointment both rely on the cultivation and 
             	  accumulation of merit from our past lives. &#8220;Those who have 
             	  millions of dollars in this life&#8221; talks about wealth and social 
             	  position for which we also need the right destiny. They are not 
             	  randomly attained. In Buddhism, it is said that for us to 
             	  possess immense wealth in this life, we need to have extensively 
             	  practiced the giving of wealth in our past lives. Can we force 
             	  nature to grant us wealth' Impossible. To try to do so will 
             	  bring disaster and misfortune. &quot;Neither misfortunes nor good 
             	  fortune come with out reasons and conditions, we incur them&quot;.             	  </p>
             	<p>The ancient Chinese who created Chinese characters had great 
             	  wisdom. The two characters for &#8220;fortune&#8221; and &#8220;misfortune&#8221; are 
             	  very similar, differing only the slightest bit. Thus, a small 
             	  discrepancy leads to a great error. All this helps us to 
             	  understand cause and effect. To understand that when we seek 
             	  fame, wealth and prestige in accordance with the teachings, we 
             	  will find that everything is attainable. </p>
             	<p>&#8220;Millions of dollars&#8221; 
             	  represents wealth of the upper class. &#8220;Thousands of dollars&#8221; 
             	  represents wealth of the middle class. Because of the good 
             	  causes planted in past lives, some people will possess upper or 
             	  middle class wealth. Those who were meant to starve to death 
             	  have committed numerous evil offenses in their past lives. They 
             	  did not practice giving, but instead were stingy and miserly. 
             	  Unfortunately, there are many people like this in the world 
             	  today. They are unwilling to do even the slightest of good deeds 
             	  or to give even a penny. They encourage others to give, but do 
             	  not follow their own advice. We know they will undergo the 
             	  consequence of being poor in their next life. We all undergo the 
             	  consequences from our causes. They are not imposed on us by an 
             	  outside power that is controlling our lives. </p>
             	<p>The master said 
             	  that the heavens do nothing more than punish those who are bad 
             	  with the suffering they have coming and reward those who are 
             	  kind with the good fortune they are worthy of. Some people in 
             	  this world assume that everything is arranged by the will of 
             	  heavenly beings. But, this is not so. The true cause of 
             	  everything that happens to us is our own behavior. Heavenly 
             	  beings do not have any intentions for us. Only the great sages 
             	  with true wisdom are able to see clearly the truth of reality. 
             	  Whether to be wealthy with a good social position or to be poor 
             	  with none is all within our destiny. </p>
             	<p>For example, if a person 
             	  has accumulated enough merits and virtues for a hundred 
             	  generations, then he or she will have descendants to last a 
             	  hundred generations. One who accumulates enough merits and 
             	  virtues to last ten generations will then have ten generations 
             	  of descendants to live out that good fortune. The same goes for 
             	  three generations or two generations. For those who have no 
             	  descendants at all, it is because they have not accumulated 
             	  enough good merits and virtues. </p>
             	<p>This talks about the destiny in 
             	  having or not having children. If we have accumulated enough 
             	  merits and virtues for a hundred generations, then we will have 
             	  a hundred generations of descendants. Great Master Yin-Guang 
             	  often praised Confucius, who cultivated the &#8220;Virtue of a Hundred 
             	  Generations&#8221;. Confucius constantly thought of benefiting the 
             	  country and people, without the slightest thought of self. He 
             	  dedicated his whole life to education and passed on his ideals 
             	  and aspirations to his students. He was the greatest educator in 
             	  Chinese history. </p>
             	<p>There have now been over seventy generations of 
             	  Confucius&#8217; descendants and his current descendant, Mr. De-Cheng 
             	  Kong, is still respected by people around the world. Not only 
             	  the Chinese, but others such as Americans are particularly 
             	  courteous and respectful, warmly welcoming him upon hearing that 
             	  he is the descendant of Confucius. It becomes very evident that 
             	  by planting good seeds or causes, we reap good harvests or 
             	  results. </p>
             	<p>In Liao-Fan's Four Lessons we read that when we 
             	  accumulate enough merits and virtues for ten generations we will 
             	  have ten generations of descendants to live out that good 
             	  fortune. In Chinese history, emperors would try to establish 
             	  dynasties that were able to reign for many generations like the 
             	  Qing Dynasty, which lasted for ten generations. But, if their 
             	  ancestors had not accumulated enough merits and virtues then it 
             	  would have been impossible. Today, people do not believe this. 
             	  They think all they need is ability, good political tactics and 
             	  knowledge. But they are wrong. Virtues accumulated by our 
             	  ancestors plus our own virtuous conduct from our past lives will 
             	  result in having similar virtuous people being born into our 
             	  family. Thus, its continuation is assured. </p>
             	<p>For instance, for how 
             	  many generations will a family business last' In Taiwan, there 
             	  is a chain of medical stores called the &#8220;Universal Compassion 
             	  Hall&#8221; that originated in Beijing. By the accumulation of virtues 
             	  and merits, it has been in business for over a hundred years and 
             	  has been passed down from one generation to the next.             	  </p>
             	<p>Compassionate ancestors, whose driving goal was to be able to 
             	  keep the store going so they could help to save lives, began it. 
             	  Unconcerned about profits, they only wanted to make enough to be 
             	  able to live very simply. So, their goal has not been to make a 
             	  profit or to enjoy a life of ease and comfort, but to benefit 
             	  society and to help people who were suffering. With this 
             	  objective, they were able to found a business that has lasted 
             	  over a hundred years. If the descendants do not deviate from 
             	  their ancestor&#8217;s objectives, this chain will be able to continue 
             	  forever. They will not be like others who lacking merits and 
             	  virtues found their businesses going bankrupt after only a few 
             	  years. </p>
             	<p>Some may only have enough merits and virtues to last for 
             	  two or three generations of descendants. The Chinese have a 
             	  saying that &#8220;There are three serious occurrences in being 
             	  unfilial, with no future generations being the most critical&#8221;. 
             	  This is lacking in merit and virtue to the point of not being 
             	  able to have any descendants. In the past, people were extremely 
             	  concerned about this, but today things are very different. Many 
             	  young couples do not even want to have children thinking them 
             	  too much trouble. Also, our society is different from that of 
             	  the past because we now have social welfare. </p>
             	<p>In many countries, 
             	  who takes care of the elderly' The country does. With no need to 
             	  rely on their children to provide for them when they become 
             	  older, many couples have decided that they can do without 
             	  children. They can retire at the age of sixty-five and collect 
             	  social security every month from the government. This is even 
             	  more filial than our own children are. This is possible because 
             	  the current social welfare system is so much better than what 
             	  transpired in the past. Before, the elderly could only rely on 
             	  their children for support, whereas now the current trend is 
             	  towards having the government to help take care of the elderly. 
             	  However, the Law of Cause and Effect will not change. </p>
             	<p>&#8220;Just as 
             	  one stores up grain against lean years, one raises children 
             	  against old age&#8221; has been a commonly held idea. Mr. Yu in his 
             	  commentary examined the teaching of transcending this world. He 
             	  said, &#8220;Sages transcending this world consider the cultivation of 
             	  ending desires and love, ridding themselves of delusion to 
             	  obtain wisdom and transcending the ordinary to become a sage to 
             	  be the utmost virtue and merit. Regretfully, this level of 
             	  attainment is not understood by ordinary people.&#8221; This idea of 
             	  raising children against old age still exists today.</p>
             	<p> Usually 
             	  when young people generate the heart to become monks and nuns, 
             	  their parents, relatives and friends try their best to think of 
             	  ways to stop them. They do not understand for they still think 
             	  like before, that not having a next generation is their biggest 
             	  concern. Buddhism looks into the three times of the past, 
             	  present and future. It sees and understands the truth of life 
             	  and the universe. </p>
             	<p>Ordinary people only see a tiny portion of 
             	  this universe, not the whole. Of the entire universe, they have 
             	  only witnessed the human realm. In the human realm, they only 
             	  see the present, neither the past nor the future; therefore, 
             	  they are unable to see as perfectly as do Buddhas and 
             	  Bodhisattvas. When someone in a family becomes a monk or nun, it 
             	  is truly the most joyous occasion, the most outstanding pursuit.             	  </p>
             	<p>However, we must practice earnestly in renouncing worldly life 
             	  for if we do not achieve, while our families will not be harmed, 
             	  we will fall into the Three Bad Realms. In Buddhism, it is often 
             	  said, &#8220;One grain of rice from a donor is as great as Mt. Sumeru. 
             	  Not transcending the cycle of birth and death in this lifetime, 
             	  consigns us to put on animal skin and horn to pay back the 
             	  debt&#8221;. This is obviously very serious. </p>
             	<p>As Pure Land 
             	  practitioners, we have to achieve a certain level of attainment 
             	  and to transcend the Six Realms to be born into the Western Pure 
             	  Land. Theravada practitioners need to at least reach the level 
             	  of stream-enterer. This is achieved by severing various wrong 
             	  views. It is the first of the four stages of sagehood in 
             	  Theravada Buddhism. By attaining the fruit of non-returning, we 
             	  will be considered a sage. At this point in achievement we will 
             	  continue to be born into the heaven and human realms and in this 
             	  way are assured of attaining the state of Arhat although it may 
             	  take a long time to do so. But by not falling into the Three Bad 
             	  Realms, we are considered to have achieved attainment. </p>
             	<p>According 
             	  to this criterion, the minimum standard to achieve attainment in 
             	  Mahayana Buddhism is to rid ourselves of a portion of our 
             	  attachments, to sever the eighty-eight kinds of deviated 
             	  thoughts and viewpoints. If we cannot rid ourselves of these 
             	  eighty-eight kinds of deviated thoughts and viewpoints, then we 
             	  have simply not achieved. In achieving this, in the perfect 
             	  Mahayana teaching, we reach the initial belief stage. In the 
             	  Theravada teaching, we reach the initial fruit of 
             	  stream-enterer, attained by destroying various wrong views; the 
             	  first of the four stages of sainthood. </p>
             	<p>Not accomplishing this 
             	  will find us still reincarnating within the Six Realms, still 
             	  paying back our debts. For monks and nuns this means we will 
             	  have to pay back every single offering from the ten directions 
             	  that were enjoyed during the time we were monks and nuns. These 
             	  offerings were not given without expectation of a reward. We 
             	  have to pay them back. </p>
             	<p>If we are able to achieve the levels of 
             	  stream-enterer or to sever the eighty-eight kinds of improper 
             	  thoughts and viewpoints, for Theravada and Mahayana 
             	  practitioners, respectively, those who have made the offerings 
             	  will receive the benefits of good fortune. Then there is no need 
             	  for us to pay them back, because they have harvested from the 
             	  fields of merit. Using these as the standard, it is not 
             	  achievable by monks and nuns of this generation. Who has the 
             	  ability to achieve this! </p>
             	<p>But, there is still another way, to 
             	  seek birth into the Western Pure Land. Otherwise, achievement is 
             	  not possible. If we cannot go to the Pure Land, we will have 
             	  achieved nothing. Seeking birth into the Pure Land is actually 
             	  much simpler than severing the eighty-eight kinds of improper 
             	  thoughts and viewpoints. To be born into the Pure Land, it is 
             	  not necessary to sever these improper thoughts and viewpoints, 
             	  for we can carry our remaining karma with us to the Pure Land. 
             	  As long as we have true unwavering belief, the vow and proper 
             	  conduct, are honestly mindful of Buddha Amitabha, everyone will 
             	  achieve attainment. We see this very clearly in the Infinite 
             	  Life Sutra and the Amitabha Sutra. Therefore, when generating 
             	  the heart to renounce worldly life and become monks and nuns, we 
             	  must achieve attainment. </p>
             	<h5>B. To Reform Faults Thoroughly</h5>
                <br />
             	<p> &quot;Now 
             	  that you recognize your own shortcomings, you need to put forth 
             	  your utmost efforts into working to change and into reforming 
             	  your misdeeds, which cause you not to have a child or become an 
             	  imperial official.&quot; </p>
             	<p>This is the method that Master Yun-Gu taught 
             	  Mr. Liao-Fan in changing his destiny, to take the right steps to 
             	  correct his bad habits and shortcomings. Since he knew his 
             	  shortcomings, the master taught him to &#8220;put his utmost efforts 
             	  into changing his ways&#8221;. Mr. Yu said in his commentary that, 
             	  &#8220;Each of us has our own faults and weaknesses, but if we are 
             	  able to calmly analyze ourselves and find them, one after 
             	  another, then we will have a starting point&#8221;. So, changing our 
             	  ways and reforming is true cultivation. It is by no means just a 
             	  formality of reciting sutras, prostrating before the Buddha or 
             	  chanting mantras. </p>
             	<p>To cultivate our whole life and to still be 
             	  mired in the Six Realms is to have simply gone through the 
             	  formalities. Their purpose is to remind us of the teachings for 
             	  others to see and to exemplify these teachings to bring forth 
             	  awakening in others. For self-cultivation however, importance is 
             	  not placed on the formalities but rather on discovering our own 
             	  faults. This is awakening. </p>
             	<p>To correct our own faults is to 
             	  achieve in our cultivation. Therefore, the most important point 
             	  is for us to be perfectly calm, introspective and watchful over 
             	  our own conduct as we search out our own bad habits and faults. 
             	  By knowing our faults and bad habits we will know where to 
             	  start, what to correct and how to proceed. </p>
             	<p>We can then 
             	  concentrate and use all of our energy to reform. The following 
             	  are some examples of this from Mr. Yu&#8217;s commentary. &#8220;We can 
             	  change from a miserly and greedy person to become one who 
             	  generously gives to those in need&#8221;. For example, if we are 
             	  miserly, we are not willing to give what we have to others. If 
             	  we are greedy, we are always trying to gain what we do not have. 
             	  If we find that we are habitually doing this, we can change 
             	  ourselves into generous people who give to those in need by 
             	  using the practice of giving to modify our behavior. What I have 
             	  and others do not, I can freely give to them upon request. Or, 
             	  better yet when I see others who have an urgent need, I can take 
             	  the initiative and simply give it to them. This is the 
             	  cultivation of good fortune. </p>
             	<p>There are three types of giving; 
             	  that of wealth, teaching and fearlessness. The giving of 
             	  teaching is practiced when we help others by using our skill or 
             	  wisdom to teach others. What others are not good at and we are, 
             	  we can enthusiastically teach them to enable them to have this 
             	  ability or to awaken their wisdom. This is the giving of 
             	  teaching. The giving of fearlessness is helping others to be 
             	  calm and serene in both body and mind. It is to help relieve 
             	  their uneasiness, their fears. For example, if someone is afraid 
             	  to walk home alone at night and we are able, we can accompany 
             	  him or her so they will no longer be apprehensive. </p>
             	<p>Today, many 
             	  young people need to serve in the military. This is another form 
             	  of the giving of fearlessness. Why' Soldiers protect a country 
             	  and its people, and keep the peace by not allowing harm or 
             	  invasion by foreign forces. We can see that the scope of these 
             	  three kinds of giving is extensive. The Buddha tells us that 
             	  with the giving of wealth, we gain wealth. With the giving of 
             	  teaching, we gain intelligence and wisdom. With the giving of 
             	  fearlessness, we gain health and longevity. </p>
             	<p>In many countries, 
             	  we can see another form of the giving of fearlessness; that of 
             	  freeing captured animals. However, we also see many improper 
             	  practices, which have risen as a result of this giving. Because 
             	  so many have wanted to free captured animals, some people have 
             	  gone into the business of capturing more animals. Freeing 
             	  animals in this way is not the giving of fearlessness but 
             	  subjects them to harm. If we do not set them free, these people 
             	  will not capture them. We would do well to understand so that 
             	  our kind heart will not inadvertently lead us to commit bad 
             	  deeds. </p>
             	<p>The proper way to practice this giving of fearlessness is 
             	  to free animals that we find in the food market when we go 
             	  shopping. We do so in the knowledge that they will be able to 
             	  survive once they are freed. This is compassion and kindness for 
             	  it is saving those beings that are suffering. However, many pet 
             	  shops sell animals that were domestically raised and therefore 
             	  would be unable to survive in the wild. If they were set free, 
             	  they would die and our good intentions would be turned into 
             	  transgressions. </p>
             	<p>So, we need to be aware of the consequences to 
             	  everything that we do. When we do occasionally find animals in a 
             	  food market and buy them to set them free, the proper way to do 
             	  so is to chant the Three Refuges of the Buddha, the Dharma and 
             	  the Sangha, and the Buddha&#8217;s name. In this way, we are saving 
             	  their lives. </p>
             	<p>The commentary talks about changing from an angry 
             	  and agitated person to one who is calm and peaceful. This talks 
             	  about our disposition. Easily giving in to anger, easily 
             	  becoming irritated is a major fault. Mr. Liao-Fan had this 
             	  fault, so the Master encouraged him to transform himself into 
             	  being serene and tranquil, to being even-tempered. With a calm 
             	  and peaceful mind, our disposition will naturally be gentle and 
             	  warm. </p>
             	<p>Both Buddha Shakyamuni and Confucius stressed this 
             	  important quality of our virtue. The students of Confucius 
             	  praised his five virtues of gentility, kindness, respectfulness, 
             	  thriftiness and humility. He was known for being gentle, kind, 
             	  respectful, thrifty and discreet towards everyone and 
             	  everything. Confucius did not live an extravagant life but 
             	  rather one of simplicity. He was courteous and humble. He never 
             	  argued and always accorded with others. Confucius was himself a 
             	  model of moral excellence. &#8220;To change from a person who 
             	  exaggerates and is boastful to one who is modest and practical&#8221;. 
             	  When we know someone who exaggerates, we automatically doubt 
             	  whatever he or she says. It is difficult for people like this to 
             	  win the confidence of others because essentially he or she is 
             	  dishonest. Therefore, we should never exaggerate or boast, but 
             	  be modest and honest in all that we say and do. &#8220;To change from 
             	  a person who is flighty and impatient to one who is settled and 
             	  stable&#8221;. We would do well to be composed and concentrated, to be 
             	  poised and calm. In this way, we will attain purity of mind. &#8220;To 
             	  change from a person who is arrogant and insolent to one who is 
             	  modest and courteous&#8221;. There really is nothing to be arrogant 
             	  about. Why' If we have accomplished something successfully, it 
             	  is our duty, something we ought to do. If we did not accomplish 
             	  it successfully then we should be criticized, corrected and told 
             	  how to improve. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas respect everyone and 
             	  everything as did Confucius and Mencius. However, we are far 
             	  behind them in achievement or understanding! Therefore, we need 
             	  to treat others with respect, courtesy and humility. These are 
             	  simply virtues of nature. &#8220;To change from a person who is 
             	  indolent and idle to one who is diligent and resolute&#8221;. Being 
             	  lethargic and lazy are great afflictions. One who has these bad 
             	  habits will not succeed in anything. Therefore, we would do well 
             	  to be diligent, purposeful and energetic. One of Buddha 
             	  Shakyamuni&#8217;s students, Anuruddha was known for his laziness. 
             	  After being reproached by the Buddha, he resolved to go without 
             	  rest or sleep for seven days and seven nights. Due to his 
             	  enthusiastic diligence, he damaged his vision. The Buddha 
             	  compassionately taught him the &quot;Illuminating the Diamond of 
             	  Delightful Observation Samadhi&quot;, a form of deep concentration, 
             	  which enabled him to see far better than before. Consequently, 
             	  he was able to see to the extent of one Buddhaland, which is 
             	  comprised of one billion galaxies. We too need to be inspired 
             	  with enthusiasm and determination. When we are lazy, we 
             	  accomplish nothing. Not only are we unable to achieve attainment 
             	  in our practice and learning of Buddhism, but we will also fail 
             	  to accomplish anything in our daily lives. Ancient times or 
             	  today, in the east or in the west no one has become successful 
             	  through laziness. Diligence is the only good root for Mahayana 
             	  practitioners and Bodhisattvas. &#8220;To change from a person who is 
             	  merciless and cruel to one who is kind and compassionate. To 
             	  change from a person who is a cowardly and fearful to one who is 
             	  brave and motivated&#8221;. To be cowardly and timorous is another 
             	  serious fault. We would do well to overcome it and to work 
             	  diligently and resolutely. Mr. Liao-Fan himself admitted to 
             	  having all these faults. Again, each of us would do well to be 
             	  like him, to examine and correct every single one of our faults. 
             	  Next, Master Yun-Gu taught Mr. Liao-Fan several essential points 
             	  for his cultivation. &#8220;You need to cultivate virtue and tolerance 
             	  and to treat others with compassion and harmony. Also, to care 
             	  for your health and conserve your energy and spirit&#8221;. First, 
             	  Master Yun-Gu encouraged Mr. Liao-Fan to accumulate merit, by 
             	  ending his erroneous ways and cultivating good deeds. This is a 
             	  foundation for improvement whether in Buddhism or in worldly 
             	  teachings. If we do not by earnestly accumulate merits and 
             	  virtues by refraining from all evils and practicing all forms of 
             	  kindness, how can we hope to be, &#8220;Those who have thousands of 
             	  dollars&#8221; or &#8220;those who have accumulated enough merit and virtue 
             	  for a hundred generations&#8221;' An entire country respected 
             	  Confucius. An entire world respected Buddha Shakyamuni. The 
             	  former accumulated great merits of this world. The latter 
             	  accumulated great merits of the universe. Second, we need to be 
             	  tolerant of others, to broaden our minds and our hearts. If not, 
             	  then we will be beset with more afflictions, which will present 
             	  further obstacles to our cultivation. We cultivate awakening, 
             	  proper thoughts and viewpoints, and purity of mind. If we cannot 
             	  attain purity of mind, then we will not be awakened. This would 
             	  result in deviated thoughts and viewpoints. Proper thoughts and 
             	  viewpoints and great enlightened thoughts rely on the foundation 
             	  of purity of mind. Therefore, we need to be able to tolerate 
             	  others. There is no need to take things too seriously, no need 
             	  to be critical of everything. As we learn in the Diamond Sutra, 
             	  &#8220;everything is like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow&#8221;. 
             	  Nothing is real. As the ancients said, every phenomenon is &#8220;as 
             	  transient as a fleeting cloud&#8221;. There is nothing worthy of 
             	  dispute. There is nothing worthy of anger. There is no point in 
             	  dwelling on anything, for this will hinder our cultivation of 
             	  purity of mind. There is every point in being gentle, loving and 
             	  peaceful. Being not so was Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s biggest problem. We 
             	  need to practice loving-kindness and compassion for everyone and 
             	  everything. The Buddha taught that these are non-discriminatory, 
             	  are equally held for all. Confucius taught of loving-kindness, 
             	  which is close to that of the Buddha&#8217;s. He explained that, &#8220;the 
             	  benevolent person has no enemies&#8221;. If we still have feelings of 
             	  hostility towards others, then we are neither kind nor 
             	  compassionate. Conflicts and hostility simply do not exist 
             	  within the heart of loving-kindness. It is the same as the great 
             	  compassion of the Buddhas. Different people, different words, 
             	  same meaning. This is what we need to learn and practice, to 
             	  truly benefit ourselves. Pure Land sutras explain &#8220;One Mind 
             	  Undisturbed&#8221;. This state is unattainable if anything exists in 
             	  conflict. To have conflict is to be of two minds, to have 
             	  something that needs to be confronted, to be thought of. Master 
             	  Hui-Neng said, &quot;originally our true mind contained nothing&quot;. If 
             	  the mind still clings to even one wandering thought, then it is 
             	  not the true mind but a false mind. If the mind is pure, if the 
             	  mind is at peace, then it will not have any conflicting 
             	  thoughts. Without any conflicting thoughts, the true mind can be 
             	  uncovered, purity of mind can arise and this is how we attain 
             	  One Mind Undisturbed. The states of One Mind Undisturbed and 
             	  Constant Mindfulness of Buddha Amitabha start from here. In 
             	  Constant Mindfulness of Buddha Amitabha, initially the mind 
             	  remembers the Buddha and does not for-get. Then after prolonged 
             	  cultivation, we con-stantly contemplate the Buddha. If we have 
             	  been chanting the Buddha&#8217;s name for many years and have not yet 
             	  reached the state of constant mindfulness, we need to determine 
             	  where the problem lies and correct it. When we have no more 
             	  obstacles, we will be able to achieve this state, which will 
             	  assure us of achieving birth into the Pure Land. Regardless of 
             	  the state of cultivation we have reached, we will know when we 
             	  have achieved it. There is no need to ask another. When we are 
             	  born into the Pure Land through the state of Constant 
             	  Mindfulness, we will be born into the Land where Both Sages and 
             	  Ordinary Beings Dwell Together. With the state of One Mind 
             	  Undisturbed in Mindfulness, we will be born into the Land Where 
             	  Everything is Temporary. With the state of One Mind Undisturbed 
             	  in Enlightenment, we will be born into the Land of Real Reward. 
             	  The level of achievement we attain will determine which land we 
             	  will be born into. There are also different levels in the state 
             	  of constant mindfulness, thus there are nine levels of birth. 
             	  People who are born into the higher three levels of birth are 
             	  able to pass away whenever they wish, are able to decide when 
             	  they will die. At that time they can go without any illness and 
             	  may be standing or seated. If they do not feel like leaving this 
             	  world yet, they can stay longer. Everything can be achieved at 
             	  will. People who are born into the middle three levels of birth 
             	  are able to know a few months in advance when they are going to 
             	  pass away. Again, they may leave this world standing or seated. 
             	  In the lower level, people will know several days in advance of 
             	  their death, when they will leave but they may become ill before 
             	   	  their time of death. People reaching the state of One Mind 
             	  Undisturbed have even higher abilities. There are two levels of 
             	  One Mind Undisturbed: mindfulness and enlightenment. Whichever 
             	  it is, it is not achievable by ordinary people like us in one 
             	  lifetime, whereas, constant mindfulness is. Therefore, in this 
             	  lifetime we can attain the state of constant mindfulness in 
             	  which we will have the ability to pass away at ease, to leave 
             	  whenever we wish. This is to be born into the Land Where Both 
             	  Sages and Ordinary Beings Dwell Together, into the higher three 
             	  levels of birth and to carry our remaining karma with us. The 
             	  Master told Mr. Liao-Fan that he should care for his health and 
             	  conserve his energy and spirit. Because Mr. Liao-Fan liked to 
             	  sit up all night and did not know how to take care of himself, 
             	  he needed to pay special attention to preserving his health and 
             	  energy. &#8220;Live as though everything of the past dissolved 
             	  yesterday and all of the future begins today. If you can 
             	  accomplish this, then you are a person born anew, a person of 
             	  virtue and sincerity&#8221;. Everything that happened yesterday is in 
             	  the past, do not dwell on them or regret what happened. Because 
             	  if we do, it is as if we have committed them again and this will 
             	  only leave additional impressions in our Alaya Consciousness 
             	  (our store consciousness, the thought database from all our past 
             	  and present lives, good or bad). Therefore, let bygones be 
             	  bygones and do not to think of them again. The important thing 
             	  is to correct what is in the present, what will be in the 
             	  future. Doubts and regrets are afflictions, which are conditions 
             	  or causes of pain, distress and suffering which disturb the body 
             	  and mind. These two above afflictions are two of the twenty-six 
             	  afflictions stated in the Sastra on the Door to Understanding 
             	  the Hundred Dharmas. The Buddha taught us not to dwell on the 
             	  past. It is stated in Mr. Xi-Yin Yu's commentary that this is 
             	  the key to change destiny for the Perfect People. The Perfect 
             	  People are those with higher levels of wisdom and those who are 
             	  awakened. There are six points to accomplish this starting from 
             	  the need to cultivate and accumulate merits and virtues to the 
             	  point when we become a &#8220;person born anew, a person of virtue and 
             	  sincerity&#8221;. These are the keys to changing destiny. Mr. Yu said 
             	  in his commentary that, &#8220;The first step in changing destiny is 
             	  to correct our faults. To brush aside all the accumulated bad 
             	  habits one by one and to pull out all roots of our problems one 
             	  by one. At all times and at all places, to be constantly 
             	  vigilant of our every thought, word and act. To be demanding of 
             	  ourselves, to be restrained and disciplined. To protect the 
             	  innocent and the virtuous as we would a newborn baby. The full 
             	  responsibility for changing our destiny is in our own hands, not 
             	  in the hands of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and heavenly beings. 
             	  People of utmost virtue are no longer being bound by destiny&#8221;. 
             	  But, we need to be strict with ourselves, not constantly 
             	  forgiving ourselves. If we do so then our future will be 
             	  limited. We need to be strict and stern with ourselves, generous 
             	  and lenient towards others. We need to overcome our faults and 
             	  to correct our bad habits. We need to protect the pure, the 
             	  virtuous, the innocent. What is innocence' It is to not have any 
             	  thought arising. If we constantly give rise to wandering 
             	  thoughts, then we lose our innocence, our true mind, our pure 
             	  mind. We need to be watchful over our wandering thoughts. To 
             	  protect these like a mother lovingly takes care of a baby, 
             	  wholeheartedly with full energy. The responsibility for changing 
             	  our destiny is completely up to us; it is not up to Buddhas, 
             	  Bodhisattvas or the beings of heaven or earth. Once we 
             	  understand the truth about being able to create our destiny, 
             	  there will no longer be any need to ask psychics or 
             	  fortunetellers what our future will be like. We would only need 
             	  to carefully reflect upon our own destiny to know what it will 
             	  be and how to change it. Also, others would not be able to 
             	  deceive us. Previously the Master told Mr. Liao-Fan about people 
             	  who were of the utmost virtue. In the Pure Land sutras, we learn 
             	  that the people of the utmost virtue live in the Pure Land. What 
             	  kinds of people are of the utmost virtue' Those who are able to 
             	  feel regret and remorse and thus are able to reform. The beings 
             	  in the Western Pure Land reflect and reform daily, until there 
             	  is nothing left that requires correction. Then they become 
             	  Buddhas. Even Equal Enlightenment Bodhisattvas, who are just one 
             	         	  level below that of Buddhas, still have faults. What kind' They 
             	  still have one degree of ignorance yet to be broken through, 
             	  that is their shortcoming. They still need to correct their 
             	  errors and start afresh. If Equal Enlightenment Bodhisattvas 
             	  still need to regret and reform, we can imagine how much we need 
             	  to do. From the above we can understand and attain awakening as 
             	  to what we need to cultivate. From now on, we will generate the 
             	  heart to regret and reform. Even upon reaching the level of 
             	  Equal Enlightenment Bodhisattvas, we will still need to do this. 
             	  For only when there is nothing left to reform, do we become 
             	  Buddhas. We cannot attain complete enlightenment even if we 
             	  still have just one remaining fault. Bodhisattvas are called 
             	  &#8220;enlightened sentient beings&#8221;, for although they are still 
             	  sentient beings, they are enlightened. Enlightenment is to know 
             	  our faults and to correct them. On the other hand, we ordinary 
             	  people are also sentient beings, but are not yet enlightened. 
             	  Not being enlightened is not knowing our faults, not knowing 
             	  that we need to correct them. It is believing that we are 
             	  correct in every way. It is thinking, &#8220;Do I have any faults&#8221;' It 
             	  is thinking for a long time and not finding any. Therefore, it 
             	  is often said that ordinary people do not have faults, but 
             	  Bodhisattvas have many. Bodhisattvas constantly watch over their 
             	  every thought, word and deed, knowing they have many 
             	  shortcomings, continuously correcting them, doing so for three 
             	  great aeons. When we think about how many faults there are, how 
             	  we possibly think that as ordinary people we do not have any! 
             	  What is the difference between &#8220;enlightened&#8221; and &#8220;not 
             	  enlightened&#8221;. One who knows that they have many faults is an 
             	  enlightened being, is a Bodhisattva. One who does not know that 
             	  they have many faults is not enlightened, is an ordinary person. 
             	  Bodhisattvas are not deities, but are those who know their own 
             	  faults and constantly strive to correct them so they can reform. 
             	  If we were to improve, not only to reform, but to generate the 
             	  vows of Buddha Amitabha then this would be the most remarkable 
             	  way of changing our destiny. We recite the Infinite Life Sutra 
             	  daily, to be very familiar with it, but this is only the 
             	  beginning step. The second step is to use the Infinite Life 
             	  Sutra as a mirror, reflecting once with each recitation to make 
             	  a comparison and to find our own faults. By looking at the 
             	  reflections in the mirror, we can see what parts are soiled and 
             	  can then immediately clean them. To clean is to correct. We need 
             	  to recite the sutra to find the pollution in our mind that we 
             	  are not yet truly aware of. The sutra is like a mirror that sees 
             	  and reflects what parts of our minds have faults so that we may 
             	  correct them at once. Therefore, the first step is to become 
             	  familiar with the sutra. The second step is to accord with the 
             	  teachings within it. In cultivation, first we generate the vows. 
             	  We need to think carefully if we have generated the forty-eight 
             	  vows of Buddha Amitabha. We need to adopt his forty-eight vows 
             	  as our own, to be of one heart and vow with him, to be his true 
             	  companion. It is to be the same, to become his manifestation. He 
             	  is our role model. We follow this model to mold ourselves, to 
             	  change ourselves to be completely the same as Buddha Amitabha. 
             	  It is to be of one mind, one heart and one vow. How could we not 
             	  be born into the Pure Land, when our heart and vow are the same 
             	  as his' When this happens we will think the same, speak the same 
             	  and act the same as him. So in every thought, word and deed we 
             	  will remember as we interact with others, matters and affairs, 
             	  not forgetting to encourage others to chant Namo Amituofo. This 
             	  is to speak and act like Buddha Amitabha. When our three karmas 
             	  of body, speech and mind are the same as his, then we become a 
             	  manifestation of him. We come again to this world to fulfill his 
             	  original vows. This is more remarkable than being a person of 
             	  virtue and sincerity. Originally, we were reincarnated into this 
             	  world as a retribution body, to pay back karmic debts, but now 
             	  we are Buddha Amitabha coming to this world through the strength 
             	  of our vows. This is the most remarkable and unsurpassable 
             	  method in changing our destiny. &quot;If even our body is governed by 
             	  destiny, then how can a body of virtue and sincerity not evoke a 
             	  response from heaven&#8221;' Here the Master was talking of wandering 
             	  thoughts and attachments. Our body really has nothing to do with 
             	  destiny. What matters is our mind. Our body is influenced mainly 
             	  by our mind. To be honest, the mind of ordinary people, is 
             	  selfish, is governed by destiny. We also fall within the control 
             	  of destiny if we use our conscious mind. We use our Eight 
             	  Consciousnesses (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, Mana and 
             	  Alaya. Information from the sixth consciousness, which is the 
             	  mind, is transmitted by the seventh consciousness, which is the 
             	  Mana, to the eighth, which is the Alaya, our store 
             	  consciousness). Why are Buddhas and Bodhisattvas able to 
             	  transcend' Because they have turned their Eight Consciousnesses 
             	  into the Four Wisdoms (the Great Perfect Mirror-wisdom, the 
             	  Wisdom of Equality, the Wisdom of Wondrous Observation and the 
             	  Wisdom of Accomplishing What is to be Done). They do not use the 
             	  Eight Consciousnesses, so they are not controlled by destiny. 
             	  After we have awakened, we too will use our awakened mind. 
             	  Currently, we are using deluded sentiments. If we use our 
             	  enlightened wisdom, how would we not &#8220;evoke a response from 
             	  heaven&#8221;! In the commentary we learn that, &#8220;Utmost sincerity can 
             	  split a stone of diamond, can evoke a response from heaven and 
             	  can change destiny&#8221;. Consider the well-known incident that 
             	  happened to the famous General Guang Lee who lived during the 
             	  Han Dynasty (approximately two thousand years ago). One time he 
             	  and his soldiers were on a march. On one side of the road, the 
             	  grass was very long. There was a large stone partially hidden in 
             	  the grass and he mistakenly thought it was a tiger. He 
             	  immediately shot an arrow at it and it went deep into its 
             	  target. After getting off his horse and going to survey his 
             	  marksmanship, he was amazed to see that it was a stone! He 
             	  thought, &#8220;I must be very strong to have shot an arrow so deep 
             	  into a stone&#8221;! He tried again but failed to repeat his 
             	  accomplishment. From this, we can see that the first shot 
             	  resulted from the utmost sincerity, or having no wandering 
             	  thought. Similarly, when Great Master Kumarajiva was about seven 
             	  years old, he lifted up a great iron bowl without so much as a 
             	  thought. But then he thought, &#8220;I am so small. How could I have 
             	  lifted it&#8221;' He tried to lift it again but failed. General Guang 
             	  Lee had mistaken the stone for a tiger and was able to shoot an 
             	  arrow into it. Master Kumarajiva thought nothing of the weight 
             	  of a great iron bowl and was able to lift it. Once they 
             	  perceived the tiger was actually a stone, the iron bowl was 
             	  extraordinarily heavy; they were unable to repeat their previous 
             	  accomplishments. Both initially acted from the mind of 
             	  sincerity, which has no wandering thoughts. Thus the stone was 
             	  split open and the iron bowl was lifted up. From these two 
             	  examples, we can confirm what is stated in the Flower Adornment 
             	  Sutra, &#8220;There are no hindrances among matters or things&#8221;. This 
             	  is achieved when the mind reaches a certain degree of purity, 
             	  when we have severed our wandering and discriminatory thoughts 
             	  and attachments. If the mind is not pure, then all phenomena 
             	  present obstacles. When the mind is pure, there are no 
             	  obstacles. &#8220;Utmost sincerity thus evokes a response from 
             	  heaven&#8221;. Confucianism speaks of wrestling with materialistic 
             	  desires, teaching us that we need to let go of desire and not to 
             	  be influenced by it. Utmost sincerity can change destiny. It is 
             	  the true mind, as explained in the Visualization Sutra, it is 
             	  the Bodhi mind, the mind of utmost sincerity, profundity, merit 
             	  dedication and vow generation. &#8220;As is said in the &quot;Tai Jia 
             	  Chapter&quot; in The Book of History, &#8216;One may run away from the 
             	  retribution of heaven, but one can never escape the retribution 
             	  for one&#8217;s own wrong deeds.&#8217;&#8221; Tai Jia was an emperor during the 
             	  Shang Dynasty, (almost four thousand years ago). During his 
             	  early years, he engaged in immoral activities. After receiving 
             	  guidance from the Great Sage Yi Yin, he amended his incorrect 
             	  ways. The previous quote was his expression of gratitude to the 
             	  great sage. To say that we may run from the retribution of 
             	  heaven means that although we have committed unkind deeds in 
             	  former lifetimes, the retribution for them is changeable by our 
             	  current cultivation and accumulation of merit and virtue in this 
             	  lifetime. The retributions of heaven are destinies and are 
             	  changeable. &#8220;But one can never escape the retribution for one&#8217;s 
             	  own wrong deeds&#8221;. These are the wrong deeds we commit in our 
             	  current life. The retributions of heaven are meted out for the 
             	  bad deeds that were committed in our past lives. The 
             	  retributions that we are to receive in this life can be changed. 
             	  Our very destiny can be changed. However, nothing can be done 
             	  regarding the retribution for the bad deeds that we commit in 
             	  our present lifetime. And if we continue to commit bad deeds, 
             	  then we will be unable to regret and reform, unable to change 
             	  our destiny. When bad causes created in the past, meet up with 
             	  present adverse catalystic conditions, the retributions for 
             	  these bad deeds will surely mature. On the other hand, although 
             	  we have created bad causes in the past, but now in the present, 
             	  we refrain from committing bad deeds we will suppress our bad 
             	  conditions. The bad causes still exist but without the 
             	  catalystic conditions, they will not mature. The principle in 
             	  changing destiny is based on the condition aspect of the Law of 
             	  Cause and Effect. Cause is what was created in the past. It is 
             	  unchangeable. But, condition is changeable or controllable. We 
             	  reap what we sow. We can plant melon and bean seeds. These are 
             	  causes. When we do so, we will grow melons and beans. These are 
             	  results. However, we cannot grow beans from melon seeds or 
             	  melons from bean seeds. Cause is fixed. Whether we will harvest 
             	  melons or beans depends on the conditions. If we would like to 
             	  harvest beans, we plant the seeds for them and put away the 
             	  melon seeds. For a cause to come into effect, appropriate 
             	  catalystic conditions are required for it to happen. For 
             	  example, for the melon or beans to grow well, the conditions 
             	  needed for that to happen include the right combination of good 
             	  soil, fertilizer, sun, air, water, etc. Even after the seed was 
             	  planted and the cause was thus created we can prevent the 
             	  condition from maturing if we do not want it to. We simply leave 
             	  the melon seed in a cup for a hundred years. The melon will not 
             	  grow. The result will not mature. Why' It does not have the 
             	  right conditions. Therefore, even though we have created bad 
             	  causes in past lives, if we refrain from wrongdoings in this 
             	  life, end our erroneous ways and cultivate kind deeds, we will 
             	  not have the bad conditions for the bad causes to come into 
             	  effect. Surely, we also created some good causes in our past 
             	  lives. How could a person have only done bad deeds and not good 
             	  ones' How could a person have only done good deeds and not bad 
             	  ones' Such a person simply does not exist. Therefore, life after 
             	  life all the deeds that we have committed have been a mixture of 
             	  good and bad. Sometimes more good, sometimes more bad. We do not 
             	  need to be afraid that we have committed more of the bad as long 
             	  as we refrain from committing any more. If we can block the bad 
             	  conditions, although we may only have a small amount of good 
             	  deeds, they too will blossom and mature. Therefore, it is 
             	  crucial that we end our erroneous ways and cultivate kind deeds. 
             	  &#8220;It is also said in the Book of Songs, &#8216;To remind us to 
             	  permanently accord with the mind of heaven and to seek the great 
             	  good fortune by our own&#8217;&#8221;. This reveals the real purpose of the 
             	  morning and evening ceremonies. The purpose of the morning 
             	  ceremony is to remind us of the vows of Buddha Amitabha. The 
             	  purpose of the evening ceremony is to look back on the day to 
             	  see if we followed the guidance of the sutra, to see if we have 
             	  been be watchful over our words and deeds. In so doing, it will 
             	  be meaningful to participate in these two ceremonies. In Buddha 
             	  Shakyamuni&#8217;s time, the content of the morning and evening 
             	  ceremonies was the Three Refuges. The words in those ceremonies 
             	  were from the &quot;Chapter of Pure Conduct&quot; from the Flower 
             	  Adornment Sutra, &#8220;To the Buddha I return and rely, vowing that 
             	  all living beings will profoundly understand the Great Way and 
             	  bring forth the heart of great understanding&#8221;. It was the same 
             	  for the morning and the evening. Ancient virtuous people 
             	  compiled our current recitation handbooks. The content was 
             	  suitable to the people practicing together at that time. But is 
             	  this recitation suitable for our own practice' If not, they need 
             	  to be modified so they will allow us to continue to correct our 
             	  faults and thus benefit from them. The same goes for repentance 
             	  ceremonies. If we were to participate in these and did the many 
             	  prostrations while our mind was still impure, not only would we 
             	  not eradicate our karmic obstacles, we would increase them. This 
             	  is similar to taking medicine when we become ill. If the 
             	  medication proved to be ineffective then we would need to change 
             	  prescriptions. The purpose of sutra recitation and of repentance 
             	  prostrations is to treat the illness in our minds to cure our 
             	  afflictions. If they are ineffective, then we need to find a 
             	  method that is effective. Therefore, the Jewel King Samadhi 
             	  Repentance Ceremony compiled by Mr. Lian-Ju Xia is more suitable 
             	  than other similar books for the problems of today&#8217;s people. 
             	  Upon careful reading, we will understand that many of its 
             	  phrases talk of our present illnesses. Hence, we need to choose 
             	  the morning and evening recitation based on our illnesses and 
             	  our problems. Now many Pure Land practitioners at the morning 
             	  and evening ceremonies recite the Infinite Life Sutra. The 
             	  purpose of this is to cultivate concentration. If we do not have 
             	  enough time for it, then for the morning ceremony we can recite 
             	  Chapter Six, which is comprised of the Forty-eight Vows. For the 
             	  evening ceremony, we can recite Chapters Thirty-two to 
             	  Thirty-seven. These six chapters talk of cause and effect, of 
             	  learning how to change ourselves. Doing this we will permanently 
             	  accord with the minds of heaven and seek the great good fortune 
             	  on our own. &#8220;The minds of heaven&#8221; means the self-nature, it does 
             	  not literally mean heaven and earth and celestial beings. 
             	  Rather, it means our own original nature. If we can accord with 
             	  our true mind then we will achieve the basic virtue, to return 
             	  to our self-nature. The Master told me &#8220;Mr. Kong had predicted 
             	  that you would not receive an imperial appointment or have a 
             	  son. These are the retributions of heaven, but even they can 
             	  still be changed. You only need to develop your virtue, 
             	  diligently try to practice kind deeds and work to accumulate 
             	  many hidden merits and virtues&#8221;. Master Yun-Gu told Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  that Mr. Kong&#8217;s prediction that he would not receive an imperial 
             	  appointment or have a son were the result of the accumulated 
             	  negative karma in his previous lives. However, these are 
             	  changeable. Destiny exists, but it is not fixed. It is not 
             	  something that is immutable. What is from the past is a 
             	  constant, what is done in the present is a variable. Master 
             	  Yun-Gu explained how we could change our own destiny. We do so 
             	  by starting from our heart &#8220;to develop our virtue&#8221;. From this, 
             	  we can see that if we were to seek and change only on the 
             	  outside, we will be &#8220;at a loss, inside and out&#8221;. We have seen 
             	  people who try to improve their environment by changing the 
             	  placement of doors, windows, etc. all to be at a loss, inside 
             	  and out. On appearance it seemed as if there was some gain, but 
             	  actually what they gained was what they were destined to have, 
             	  it was still within their destiny, a constant, not a variable. 
             	  We need to change from our thoughts, from our heart, to refrain 
             	  from wrongdoings and to cultivate only kind deeds. &#8220;Work to 
             	  accumulate many hidden merits and virtues&#8221;. These are our good 
             	  deeds that others do not know about. If we did something that 
             	  was good and then made it widely known, so that others praised 
             	  it, then we have lost our reward for good deeds. To do what is 
             	  good and then to lose the benefits from it at the same time will 
             	  deter us from accumulating merits and virtues. It is much better 
             	  to do good deeds without anybody knowing about them, even better 
             	  if some people verbally reproach us, for this will help to 
             	  reduce our negative karma. It would be best for us if our 
             	  negative karma and retributions were to be reduced and even 
             	  eradicated, while the good, the merits and virtues remained 
             	  hidden. Today, when we do good deeds and are subjected to 
             	  criticism and slander, we feel it is undeserved. Why do we have 
             	  negative results when we do good deeds' Actually, those are good 
             	  rewards. If we did some good deeds and were immediately 
             	  complimented by others, the merit and virtue would be 
             	  immediately cancelled. Therefore, we must accumulate merit and 
             	  virtue while hiding them, not letting others know of them. Only 
             	  then is this a truly good deed. These are your own transactions 
             	  to create good fortune. How is it then possible that you will 
             	  not get to enjoy them'&#8221; We will be able to enjoy all of the good 
             	  fortune that we have created in this life. The sutras tell us 
             	  that &#8220;Cause and effect are joined through the three times of 
             	  past, present and future&#8221;. Both our rewards and our retributions 
             	  in this life are the results of deeds in past lives. What is 
             	  cultivated in this one, will be born by us in our future lives. 
             	  If we cultivate very diligently, then without having to wait 
             	  until our next life, we will see the results in the present one. 
             	  Based on this principle, Mr. Liao-Fan completely changed his 
             	  destiny. He had accumulated so many good deeds that he did not 
             	  have to wait until his next life to enjoy the results. &#8220;I Ching, 
             	  The Book of Changes, was written to help people bring about good 
             	  fortune and to avoid adversity. If everything is predestined 
             	  with no room for change, then how can we improve upon our good 
             	  fortune and avoid adversity'&#8221; It could be said that I Ching, the 
             	  Book of Changes was the earliest philosophy book in ancient 
             	  China. It contains the most profound philosophy, which taught 
             	  people to become sages and the virtuous. It accomplishes this 
             	  through mathematical predestination. It contains sixty-four 
             	  combinations. Each combination has six explanations or 
             	  predictions, single and divided lines in eight groups of three 
             	  lines. There are three hundred eighty four possible 
             	  explanations. From within to deduce and develop the change in 
             	  positive or softness and negative or hardness, able to know the 
             	  happenings in past and future. Changes as small as those that 
             	  affect individuals to changes that affect countries to even 
             	  those that affect the world can be deduced from these symbols. 
             	  This is simply following the natural Law of Cause and Effect, 
             	  something that can be calculated and deduced. However, what the 
             	  Master knew enabled him to surpass mathematical calculations so 
             	  Mr. Liao-Fan's destiny was changed. What can be extrapolated is 
             	  constant, what cannot be is variable. Their shared purpose is to 
             	  teach people to &#8220;bring about good fortune and avoid adversity&#8221;. 
             	  The constants are a set number. I Ching, the Book of Changes 
             	  knew the variables. One virtuous thought is a plus and one 
             	  negative thought is a minus. So every day is simply a matter of 
             	  calculating every plus, every minus, every multiplication, every 
             	  division. If the margin of change is not too much then others 
             	  can foretell our destiny with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 
             	  After having his destiny foretold by Mr. Kong, for twenty years 
             	  Mr. Liao-Fan neither increased nor decreased his bad or good 
             	  thoughts and deeds, but completely accorded with his destiny. 
             	  For ordinary people usually there are some changes, one virtuous 
             	  thought, one unkind deed, not like Mr. Liao-Fan who had no 
             	  interest in doing good deeds or bad ones, but maintained a 
             	  constancy throughout, thus, his destiny was remarkably accurate. 
             	  If the good or bad deeds are changed enough then we would 
             	  surpass the constant and, thus, &#8220;we can improve upon our good 
             	  fortune and avoid adversity&#8221; and this is something we can strive 
             	  for. It is stated in the commentary, &#8220;Because all thoughts, 
             	  viewpoints and behavior are ever-changing, so all the 
             	  consequences of gain and loss, joy and pain seem flexible and 
             	  changeable. These consequences can be added, subtracted, 
             	  multiplied and divided, received and lost according with the 
             	  behavior of each individual&#8221;. A constant is the cause. A 
             	  variable is the condition. The key to changing destiny is 
             	  determined by the condition and it is the condition that 
             	  Buddhism stresses. &#8220;All the infinite creations on earth and 
             	  heaven arise from conditions&#8221;. All existing things arise from 
             	  condition. By controlling this variable, we can change destiny. 
             	  Then, we can pursue our own wishes and goals to gain remarkable, 
             	  perfect results. The Buddha also told us in the sutra that 
             	  &#8220;Impermanence, no ego, Nirvana&#8221;. Understanding this principle, 
             	  we can become virtuous, sages, can become Arhats, Bodhisattvas, 
             	  Buddhas. &#8220;The very first chapter of I Ching, The Book of Changes 
             	  also said, &#8216;Families who often perform kind deeds will have an 
             	  excess of good fortune to pass on to the next generations.&#8217; Do 
             	  you believe this&#8221;' I replied &#8220;Yes&#8221;. From this, we know that I 
             	  Ching, The Book of Changes understood the constant, the cause, 
             	  in this world, in the universe. However, it also knew that there 
             	  is a variable, the condition within. By controlling this 
             	  variable, on a smaller scale we can change our own destiny. On a 
             	  larger scale, we can pursue lasting stability and peace for our 
             	  country and our world. The I Ching is truly extraordinary, 
             	  however, it is a pity that now it has virtually become a 
             	  fortune-telling book. As Mr. Guang-Xi Mei said in the preface of 
             	  the Infinite Life Sutra, &#8220;Originally, the Amitabha Sutra was a 
             	  teaching that helped us to transcend the cycle of birth and 
             	  death to become a Buddha. But now it has become something for 
             	  people to recite at memorial services to send off the deceased!&#8221; 
             	  That the Amitabha Sutra has been reduced to this sad state is 
             	  just like I Ching, the Book of Changes being reduced to a book 
             	  for telling fortunes! It is a sad reflection on our times. I 
             	  Ching, the Book of Changes was intended to teach us how to 
             	  obtain happiness, world peace and stability, to change our 
             	  destiny by accumulating merit and virtue. To do this, we first 
             	  need to regret and reform. The Master asked Mr. Liao-Fan if he 
             	  believed that a family, which practiced kind deeds would have so 
             	  much good fortune that it would be passed on to the following 
             	  generations. Mr. Liao-Fan replied &#8220;Yes&#8221;. So, the essential 
             	  factor that enabled Mr. Liao-Fan to change his destiny was his 
             	  ability to deeply and to perfectly believe what the Master 
             	  taught him. It was the maturing of his good roots and good 
             	  fortune that provided him with opportunity to meet Master 
             	  Yun-Gu. As the Buddha told us, &#8220;Good roots, merits and virtues, 
             	  and conditions&#8221; are the ultimate benefit. When Mr. Liao-Fan had 
             	  all three, how could his destiny not change' Mr. Yu told us in 
             	  his commentary that, &#8220;One who is doubtful when he or she hears 
             	  kind words of encouragement from sages may even slander them. 
             	  They thus commit the offense of doubt&#8221;. Kind words are the 
             	  teachings of the sages of this world and beyond, later 
             	  generations called these teachings sutras. The sutras tell us of 
             	  the truths that never change. They surpass time and space. The 
             	  truth that surpasses time is the same now, as it was thousands 
             	  of years ago, it never changes whether in the east or in the 
             	  west. Upon reading this, we know that the writings and teachings 
             	  of these sages, whether of our time or beyond, do not come from 
             	  their personal experiences and opinions. If they did then they 
             	  could be biased or inappropriate. History is accumulated 
             	  experience. The sutras contain the truth, which arises from the 
             	  true nature, the original nature. Thus, it is the absolute truth 
             	  that surpasses time and space. If we are able to believe, we 
             	  will benefit and improve. If we do not believe, then we will 
             	  miss these remarkable benefits. Thus, Buddhism talks of &#8220;doubt 
             	  being the root of offense&#8221;. And doubt is one of the six 
             	  fundamental afflictions of greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, 
             	  doubt and deviated viewpoints. The commentary also stated that, 
             	  &#8220;One who hears kind words of advice and gives rise to belief 
             	  will have the appearance of good fortune and merit. This belief 
             	  is the mother of good fortune&#8221;. &#8220;Mother&#8221; means to give rise, to 
             	  grow. All good fortune and merit arise from belief in the 
             	  teachings of the sages. If we are able to believe in the words 
             	  and teachings of the sages, we will find that all infinite good 
             	  fortune and merit are generated from this. Mr. Liao-Fan is 
             	  indeed a rare person, to deeply believe upon hearing Master 
             	  Yun-Gu&#8217;s advice. To Surpass Destiny by Cultivating Good Fortune 
             	  and Accumulating Virtue I gratefully accepted his advice paid my 
             	  respects to him by prostrating. Then I began to regret all my 
             	  past wrongdoings, whether large or small, in front of the 
             	  Buddha&#8217;s image. I wrote down my wish to pass the imperial 
             	  examinations and vowed to complete three thousand meritorious 
             	  deeds to show my gratitude towards ancestors, earth and heaven. 
             	  Here we see Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s sincere act of honoring the teacher 
             	  and revering his teachings. He did not casually say, &#8220;I believe 
             	  and will do so accordingly&#8221; and then forget all about it after a 
             	  while. He earnestly complied with them. What follows is Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan&#8217;s own account of how he regretted each of his 
             	  wrongdoings in front of the Buddha, without holding anything 
             	  back. This is the expression of our own sincere repentance, 
             	  asking the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to be our witness. The Jewel 
             	  King Samadhi Repentance is very long, as was Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s 
             	  written confession, which lists all of his wrongdoings. The 
             	  commentary stated that, &#8220;'A Family Lesson'&quot; by Zhu-Zi tells us 
             	  that it is a serious error to fear that others will know our 
             	  misdeeds&#8221;. We need not be afraid of letting others know about 
             	  our faults. If we are truly intelligent and wise, we will expose 
             	  our faults and shortcomings to as many people as possible. Then 
             	  when we are criticized and corrected, our karmic obstacles will 
             	  be gradually eradicated. If we hide our faults, they will 
             	  increase in number. The consequences from this would be 
             	  inconceivable! Consequently, if others speak out about them, be 
             	  grateful. Even if we have not done what they say, if we are 
             	  innocent of the accusation. To be wrongfully accused by others 
             	  will also eradicate our karmic obstacles. There is no need to 
             	  refute them or to defend ourselves. If we constantly defend 
             	  ourselves, when we really do have faults others will not want to 
             	  try to correct them, then that offense will become even more 
             	  serious. Tai-Zong, a great emperor of the Tang Dynasty is 
             	  remembered for being wise and accomplished. Why' He did not hide 
             	  his shortcomings. Anyone could talk to him about them. Although 
             	  he was the emperor, he did nothing to retaliate against them for 
             	  doing so. Why' He knew the need to regret and reform. (Also, he 
             	  knew that if he retaliated, no one would ever dare to advise him 
             	  again.) Mr. Liao-Fan vowed to pass the imperial examinations but 
             	  Mr. Kong had not destined this for him. To gain what we wish for 
             	  when it has not been destined to happen in this lifetime is 
             	  truly to have sought and gained. He made the vow to complete 
             	  three thousand meritorious deeds to show his gratitude towards 
             	  ancestors, spirits of heaven and earth. Upon hearing my vow, 
             	  Master Yun-Gu showed me a merit-fault chart and taught me how to 
             	          	  keep a daily record of all the kind and unkind acts I did. He 
             	  told me that bad deeds would neutralize the good ones. Master 
             	  Yun-Gu presented Mr. Liao-Fan with a merit-fault chart. It 
             	  provided for the entry of both virtuous merits as well as 
             	  faults. This chart was very popular during the latter years of 
             	  the Ming Dynasty. Scholars as well as Buddhists used it to 
             	  cultivate their moral characters. Great Master Lian-Qi drew up a 
             	  merit-fault chart called the &#8220;Self-reflection Record&#8221;, which 
             	  totally based its standards for good and bad behavior on 
             	  Buddhism. It was thus especially helpful for Buddhists to use 
             	  for ending erroneous ways and cultivating kind deeds. There are 
             	  several versions of merit-fault charts that have been passed 
             	  down over the years, which can be used for our reference. Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan lived five hundred years ago. His background and manner 
             	  of living were very different from ours. However, we can still 
             	  abide by the principles, using our wisdom to determine how we 
             	  can adapt them to fit our current society and how we can use 
             	  them to accomplish our goals. Currently, no one has come up with 
             	  a merit-fault chart for modern people, but we need to know the 
             	  spirit within. The Master also taught me to recite the Zhun Ti 
             	  Mantra. Only with a pure and concen-trated mind could what I 
             	  seek for come true. In Esoteric Buddhism, Zhun Ti Bodhisattva is 
             	  a manifestation of Guan Yin, Great Compassion Bodhisattva. Why 
             	  did the Master teach Mr. Liao-Fan to chant a mantra incantation 
             	  instead of reciting a sutra' The purpose of chanting a mantra is 
             	  to uncover our pure mind, to eradicate our wandering thoughts. 
             	  Mantras are directly transliterated from Sanskrit. They have no 
             	  meanings so we will not be tempted to think of them. Rather we 
             	  will simply and continuously chant them. In so doing, over a 
             	  long period of time, our minds will become pure. Thus, our goal 
             	  will be attained. The goal remains the same whether we are 
             	  reciting sutras, chanting mantras or a Buddha&#8217;s name. But, it is 
             	  important that we teach others the method that is most suitable 
             	  for them. For example, if the Master had taught Mr. Liao-Fan to 
             	  recite sutras, he would have been tempted to analyze their 
             	  meaning. Thus, he was taught to chant a mantra. There is a 
             	  saying in Buddhism that, &#8220;Reciting a sutra is not as good as 
             	  chanting a mantra and chanting a mantra is not as good as 
             	  chanting a Buddha&#8217;s name&#8221;. What is important is that all 
             	  emphasize cultivation. Today, we lack the fundamental education 
             	  that our ancestors had. We are unable to follow the advice of 
             	  ancient people, &#8220;It is not too late to mend the fold even after 
             	  the sheep are lost&#8221;. So for the first few years of our practice, 
             	  we can concentrate on memorizing the Infinite Life Sutra. This 
             	  is especially practical for young people. The best time to learn 
             	  is during the golden years of learning, before the age of 
             	  twenty. If we are able to memorize the sutra and recite it by 
             	  heart, we will benefit from it our whole life. This method 
             	  provides us with four benefits. First, we would not forget the 
             	  Chinese language. This is especially important for those of 
             	  Chinese descent living abroad. It would enable them to remember 
             	  their origins. Second, we would be able to understand the 
             	  Chinese characters. Third, we would be well-versed in classical 
             	  Chinese much more, which would provide us with the ability to 
             	  read the Complete Library in Four Divisions. These books have 
             	  been passed down through five thousand years of Chinese history. 
             	  They contain the essence of the wisdom and experience of past 
             	  sages and virtuous ancients to be absorbed as our own knowledge. 
             	  Fourth, we would also have the ability to read Buddhist sutras 
             	  as they serve as the foundation for practicing Buddhism. 
             	  Buddhism is the ultimate perfect wisdom, thus reciting sutras by 
             	  heart is a very important foundation. If we are able to end our 
             	  erroneous ways, practice kind deeds and cultivate purity of 
             	  mind, then in due time whatever we seek will be attained. Master 
             	  Yun-Gu explained that it had been said by specialists in drawing 
             	  talismanic figures, &#8220;Those who are considered experts in the art 
             	  of drawing charms but who do not know the right way to do so 
             	  will be laughed at by spirits&#8221;. The key to drawing charms is 
             	  having no thoughts from start to finish. With this 
             	  understanding, start with the first stroke, which is called a 
             	  good beginning. In the process of drawing, one must let go of 
             	  all wandering thoughts. Do not even give rise to a single 
             	  thought of goodness. Only under these circumstances can a charm 
             	  be effective. Charms are a form of ancient magic in Taoism, 
             	  similar to mantra chanting in Buddhism. If a supposed expert in 
             	  the art of drawing symbols does not know how to properly draw 
             	  one, then the spirits would laugh at him or her. There is a 
             	  secret to drawing this symbol so that it is effective. The key 
             	  is to not give rise to thoughts. This same principle applies to 
             	  chanting mantras. Some people are able to effectively chant 
             	  mantras. For example, the Great Compassion Water, which is 
             	  consecrated by the &#8220;Great Compassion Mantra&#8221; recitation, can be 
             	  very effective for some, not at all effective for others. Why' 
             	  The former did not have a single wandering thought from start to 
             	  finish. If during the chanting a wandering thought arises, then 
             	  the mantra will be ineffective. Therefore, the longer the 
             	  mantra, the more difficult it is to successfully chant it. The 
             	  &#8220;Surangama Mantra&#8221; can be very effective. However, few people 
             	  today are able to chant it effectively. Why' The vast majority 
             	  of people have many wandering thoughts while they are chanting 
             	  it. And it only takes one wandering thought to render our 
             	  chanting ineffective. It is the same with sutra recitation. If 
             	  we recite one round of the Infinite Life Sutra without having 
             	  any wandering thoughts, it would be outstanding! Without doubt, 
             	  we would be in correspondence with all the Buddhas throughout 
             	  the universe in the past, present and future. Therefore, we need 
             	  to recite the sutra with a mind of purity, equality, sincerity 
             	  and respect to form a connection with them. But if we recite the 
             	  sutra while having wandering thoughts, we will not receive a 
             	  response. From this, we know that the shorter the mantra the 
             	  easier it will be for us to recite it and to concentrate on it. 
             	  And chanting &#8220;Namo Amituofo&#8221; is even shorter. If we still think 
             	  that even this is too long, Master Lian-Qi taught us to chant 
             	  just &#8220;Amituofo&#8221;. If we chant this without one single thought, 
             	  then it will be effective. It would be just like sending a 
             	  telegram to Buddha Amitabha and having him receive it. But, if 
             	  we add a wandering thought, then Buddha Amitabha will not be 
             	  able to receive the message and there will be no response. 
             	  Master Yun-Gu continued, &#8220;When one prays for and seeks for 
             	  something or tries to change one&#8217;s fate, it is important that 
             	  one does so without giving rise to a single thought. In this 
             	  way, one will easily receive a response&#8221;. When we seek something 
             	  from the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas or the beings of heaven or earth, 
             	  we need to do so without having any thoughts or considerations 
             	  for our seeking to be effective. To achieve this, our minds need 
             	  to be truly pure, without any wandering thoughts. This is the 
             	  mind of sincerity, purity and respect. Only when we appeal to 
             	  the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas using the mind of utmost sincerity 
             	  will we attain what we wish for. The same principle applies when 
             	  some people make offerings to their ancestors, when they appeal 
             	  in front of the ancestral plaque. It would be useless to do so 
             	  with an impure mind. Therefore, in the past making offerings to 
             	  ancestors was a grand ceremony. For example, some Chinese who 
             	  officiated at the ceremony needed to fast and bathe for three 
             	  days before the religious observation. For these three days, 
             	  this person cultivated purity of mind by shutting themselves in 
             	  a small room to try to let go of attachments. In Buddhism, this 
             	  is called &#8220;Contemplation&#8221;, a ceremony honoring the deity or 
             	  ancestor as if they were present. In doing so at the time of the 
             	  ceremony, the spirit of that ancestor will appear. When we pay 
             	  respect to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas at way places, are they 
             	  present' Not necessarily. The presence of the images does not 
             	  mean they are there. If the practitioners at this way place, 
             	  whether ordained or lay persons, are sincere and pure in mind, 
             	  then Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will be present. If they are not, 
             	  then more often than not there will be some demons impersonating 
             	  Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. This is explained in the Surangama 
             	  Sutra. &quot;Mencius discussed in 'Learning to Create Destiny' that, 
             	  'There is no difference between a long life and a short life.' 
             	  At first glance, one would find this hard to understand. How can 
             	  long life and short life be the same' In fact, when we do not 
             	  give rise to thought there is no duality in short or long life&quot;. 
             	  Short life and long life are completely different, why say they 
             	  are the same' Giving rise to wandering thoughts, discriminatory 
             	  thoughts and attachments creates duality. Without discriminatory 
             	  thoughts and attachments, there is no duality. &#8220;When we do not 
             	  give rise to thoughts, there is no duality in short and long 
             	  life&#8221;. It is evident that only when the mind is pure are we able 
             	  to see non-duality. Short life and long life do not differ for 
             	  nothing in the universe has duality. In Buddhism, this is called 
             	  &#8220;entering the state of non-duality&#8221;. As explained in the Speech 
             	  of Vaisali Sutra the state of duality is called One Mind 
             	  Undisturbed in the Pure Land School and One True Dharma Realm in 
             	  the Flower Adornment Sutra. It is the state of Buddhahood. 
             	  Mencius also talked about the state of non-duality. Thus, it is 
             	  evident that this is the state of mind of Bodhisattvas above the 
             	  level of ground states. &#8220;Separately analyze re-creating destiny. 
             	  When there is no duality between wealth and poverty we will be 
             	  able to create and form our own destiny&#8221;. We would do well to be 
             	  content with things as they are, to settle down and get on with 
             	  our work. There is a saying, &quot;If the rich were content to be 
             	  rich and the poor were content to be poor&quot; society would be 
             	  stable, the world would be peaceful and all would be joyful. 
             	  What is being joyful' Not having any wandering thoughts, worries 
             	  or afflictions. If a beggar were able to understand that his or 
             	  her current condition was a matter of destiny, then he or she 
             	  would also be very much at ease, very fortunate and happy. There 
             	  was a good example of this that happened in the early part of 
             	  this century. At that time there was a beggar in a village in 
             	  Jiangsu Province who would beg for food during the day. At 
             	  night, he would sleep in old deserted way places. In this way, 
             	  he led a life of ease and joy. Then, his son, due to his success 
             	  in business became rich and influential. However, the father was 
             	  still begging for food. The son found himself being admonished. 
             	  &#8220;How can you be such an unfilial son' You have such great 
             	  wealth. How can you let your father still beg for his food!&#8221; The 
             	  son felt ashamed after hearing this and sent out people to 
             	  search everywhere for his father and bring him to his home, so 
             	  he could take care of him. But after a month of living in his 
             	  son&#8217;s home, the father sneaked out to resume his life as a 
             	  beggar. People asked the father, &#8220;Wouldn't it better for you to 
             	  enjoy good fortune at your son&#8217;s home'&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I was very 
             	  uncomfortable there! Now, in the daytime I can travel anywhere I 
             	  want. I can enjoy visiting beautiful scenery and can make any 
             	  place my home at night. There is nothing more joyful than to 
             	  live as freely as this. To have to remain at home is suffering 
             	  for me!&#8221; He was content with his condition so he could let go 
             	  and attain true liberation. He was not affected the slightest 
             	  bit by the five desires of wealth, lust, fame, food or drink and 
             	  sleep. Rather, he was happy and had purity of mind. He preferred 
             	  to be on the sidelines, regarding this world as a play. 
             	  Everybody else was busy pursuing prestige and wealth. This was 
             	  no ordinary person, but a model of wisdom and contentment. Most 
             	  people pursue a happy and fulfilling life, not realizing that 
             	  happiness and fulfillment are not necessarily synonymous with 
             	  wealth or social status. Therefore, we need to understand about 
             	  destiny, need to be able to adjust to &#8220;accord with sentient 
             	  beings and be joyful over other&#8217;s meritorious deeds&#8221;. Only in 
             	  this way will our lives be happy and fulfilling. &quot;When there is 
             	  no duality between failure and success, then we can control the 
             	  fate of prestige and lack of position. When there is no duality 
             	  between short life and long life, then we can control the 
             	  destiny of life and death. The most important concern for human 
             	  beings is that of life and death. So talking about early death 
             	  and longevity encompass all conditions, whether favorable or 
             	  unfavorable, whether gain or loss&quot;. &#8220;To live or die at will&#8221; 
             	  includes according with all conditions. Regardless of favorable 
             	  or unfavorable conditions, we will be completely at ease. 
             	  Everything becomes clear and logical. We can have good fortune 
             	  and attain the great liberation. This is true living. True 
             	  happiness is not achievable without great knowledge and our 
             	  actual efforts in practice. We can now clearly see that only an 
             	  awakened person can settle their mind and create destiny. We can 
             	  likewise clearly see that it is hopeless for the deluded to be 
             	  immoral in behavior, becoming increasingly deluded. Thus, the 
             	  Buddha often referred to the deluded as pitiful creatures. &#8220;We 
             	  have to wait until our cultivation reaches a certain level then 
             	  our destiny will change. This change depends on the accumulation 
             	  of merits, on seeking a response from the heavens. When 
             	  cultivating, one needs to be aware of one&#8217;s own faults and 
             	  resolve to correct them just as in curing a sickness&#8221;. We 
             	  cultivate, waiting for our destiny to change, to be created. 
             	  Changing destiny is not something accomplished within a day or 
             	  two, but over a long time. We need to confidently and diligently 
             	  strive to improve. These relate to our own laziness and the need 
             	  for diligence and awakening. We must be awakened and not 
             	  deluded, proper and not deviated to strive diligently for 
             	  improvement. In time, we will attain the desired result. 
             	  Cultivation is correcting the faults in the three karmas of 
             	  improper thoughts, speech and behavior. We need to correct our 
             	  improper viewpoints, bad intentions and improper conduct, to 
             	  adopt whatever ways are necessary to remedy these faults. &#8220;While 
             	  waiting we should let go of the thought of desiring something 
             	  that we are not supposed to have and the thought of wishing to 
             	  receive a reward&#8221;. It is wandering thoughts to strongly hope for 
             	  an early harvest of reward [C1] for our good deeds. 
             	  Unfortunately, this kind of thinking can create obstacles. It is 
             	  said that we should, &#8220;Only ask about the reaping, not the 
             	  harvest&#8221;. As long as we are diligent in our cultivation, the 
             	  harvest will naturally follow, why bother to seek it everyday' 
             	  This teaches us the true way of cultivation, of not seeking for 
             	  anything. We only need to concentrate on ending our improper 
             	  ways and cultivating kind deeds. Then, in the end we will attain 
             	  whatever we desire. There is no need to seek for everything will 
             	  be attained. If we are seeking then what we can attain is 
             	  limited. Most likely, we will receive only what we seek. When we 
             	  do not seek, we attain everything. Everything is a manifestation 
             	  of and in correspondence with our virtuous nature. Therefore, 
             	  when we do not seek, everything can be attained. When we are 
             	  seeking, cultivation of virtue is not in correspondence with our 
             	  virtuous nature. This will limit what we will attain. Actually, 
             	  what Mr. Liao-Fan attained was cultivation of virtue. It was not 
             	  yet virtuous nature, because he still sought. First he sought 
             	  scholarly honor and official rank, then he sought children. 
             	  Whatever he sought, he attained. If he did not have one thought 
             	  of a request, if he solely cultivated and accumulated virtue, 
             	  then everything would have turned out perfectly. He did not seek 
             	  longevity and yet he lived longer than destined. He was supposed 
             	  to only live to the age of fifty-three, but instead lived to 
             	  seventy-four. We need to cease our requesting and affinity 
             	  seeking. Sensible wishes are ones in which we ask that our lives 
             	  be smooth. That we have enough to eat, a safe place to live and 
             	  adequate clothing. It would be enough to live comfortably in a 
             	  small house with minimal expenses and to have a simple life. But 
             	  most people want to have luxuries and to impress others, not 
             	  knowing the price they have to pay for these extravagances. They 
             	  lose more than they gain. But if instead we share our good 
             	  fortune with others then our good fortune will become the 
             	  accumulation of merit. If we cultivate and accumulate enough 
             	  virtue to last for a hundred generations, then our descendants 
             	  would have inexhaustible enjoyment. If we were truly intelligent 
             	  and wise people, we would share our excessive good fortune with 
             	  others. Therefore, we need to be patient. Why seek for the early 
             	  arrival of good fortune when it will come in good time' &#8220;It 
             	  would be quite an accomplishment in achieving these teachings to 
             	  be able to reach the innate &#8216;State of No Thought&#8217;. It is the 
             	  actual learning and practice of wisdom.&#8221; Master Yun-Gu told me 
             	  &#8220;I know that you are still unable to accomplish the &#8216;State of No 
             	  Thought&#8217;, but you can practice reciting the Zhun Ti Mantra 
             	  continuously without counting the number of recitations and 
             	  without interruption. When you reach a higher level of constant 
             	  mindfulness, you will be able to achieve the level of &#8216;to not 
             	  recite when reciting and to recite when not reciting&#8217;. When you 
             	  no longer give rise to wandering thoughts, the mantra will 
             	  become effective and successful.&#8221; Actual learning and practice 
             	  is true knowledge. Reaching achievement is what Buddhists call 
             	  &#8220;returning to the original state&#8221;. It is to reveal our original 
             	  self-nature, which is not the state of an ordinary being. There 
             	  is true happiness within. It is to be filled with the Dharma 
             	  joy, to truly abandon suffering for happiness. This is what 
             	  awakened people seek. This method taught by Master Yun-Gu 
             	  enables us to practice concurrently the Three Learnings of 
             	  self-discipline or abiding by the precepts, deep concentration 
             	  and wisdom. This type of method is called &#8220;perfect practice with 
             	  perfect attainment&#8221; what the Flower Adornment Sutra explains as 
             	  &#8220;One is all, all is one. To cultivate one method is to cultivate 
             	  all methods.&#8221; The essence of the practice is still to do so 
             	  without interruptions, without intermingling with other thoughts 
             	  or other methods. Is there a need to count the recitations' 
             	  Master Yun-Gu did not tell him to do so, but rather to recite 
             	  continuously. Many ancient sages required practitioners to start 
             	  their practice of chanting by keeping track of the number of 
             	  recitations. Why' Because like us, they were lazy and lacked 
             	  diligence. Thus, it was helpful to have a goal for the 
             	  practitioner to meet a required number of recitations a day. For 
             	  example, to chant the Buddha&#8217;s name ten thousand times a day. 
             	  Meeting this daily goal helped to counteract the bad habits of 
             	  laziness and indolence. If we do not count, we may forget to 
             	  practice. For someone as honest and earnest as Mr. Liao-Fan, 
             	  there was no need to keep track of the recitations, instead that 
             	  would have served as intermingling. His cultivation was truly 
             	  learned and diligent, thus he was able to practice without 
             	  interruption, without intermingling with other thoughts and 
             	  methods. All methods are equal. No one is different from the 
             	  others. Attainment lies in delving deeply into only one method 
             	  for a long time. In the past, people generally practiced sutra 
             	  recitation, but whether reciting sutras, chanting mantras or a 
             	  Buddha's name, we all need to practice with the mind of purity, 
             	  equality and respect. We all need to practice continuously to 
             	  truly attain the effects from practice. The state of &#8220;No 
             	  thought&#8221; is essential. It is to not have any wandering thoughts, 
             	  discriminatory thoughts or attachments. Although Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  had not given rise to any wandering thoughts for three days 
             	  while he was meditating with Master Yun-Gu at the meditation 
             	  hall, he had not yet reached the state of &#8220;No thought&#8221;. He had 
             	  just used belief, not concentration, to suppress his 
             	  afflictions. He believed that all was destined. He believed in 
             	  Cause and Effect. Therefore, Master Yun-Gu taught him a way to 
             	  move on to the next level, to cultivate concentration. To recite 
             	  the Zhun Ti Mantra is to always cultivate concentration. In 
             	  ridding ourselves of wandering thoughts and attachments, our 
             	  true nature will thus be uncovered. The Buddha spoke many times 
             	  of &#8220;the original nature as it is&#8221;. It is the same thing as One 
             	  Mind Undisturbed in the Pure Land School. This is the goal of 
             	  our practice and the true and perfect achievement. It is to 
             	  reach the achievement of &#8220;to not recite when reciting and to 
             	  recite when not reciting&#8221;. This is often explained as &#8220;not being 
             	  attached to the act of chanting, thus to not chant when chanting 
             	  and to chant when not chanting&#8221;. We do so whether we are 
             	  chanting a Buddha&#8217;s name or reciting the sutra. Therefore, when 
             	  we recite the Infinite Life Sutra without attachment, we can 
             	  first achieve Constant Mindfulness of Buddha Amitabha and then 
             	  One Mind Undisturbed. It is evident that although the methods 
             	  may differ, the principles and the goal are all the same. When 
             	  we reach the state of &#8220;No thought&#8221;, when the reciting becomes 
             	  second nature, it will naturally become effective. There are 
             	  three levels of achievement. The upper level is One Mind 
             	  Undisturbed in Enlightenment, the middle level is One Mind 
             	  Undisturbed in Mindfulness and the lower level is Constant 
             	  Mindfulness of Buddha Amitabha, which is where our cultivation 
             	  starts. Therefore, we cannot be proud when our achievement 
             	  reaches a certain level for if we do so then we will be unable 
             	  to advance further. Reaching the upper level of Constant 
             	  Mindfulness, we may have the ability to transcend this world at 
             	  will, to leave anytime we wish. Whenever we want to go, Buddha 
             	  Amitabha will come to escort us to the Western Pure Land. 
             	  Although we have reached this level of achievement and are able 
             	  to pass away with ease, it is best to stay longer in this world. 
             	  Why' The Infinite life Sutra tells us that to practice in our 
             	  World of Suffering for one day is the same as to practicing in 
             	  the Pure Land for a hundred years. We can stay in this world to 
             	  train our endurance. The second and even more important purpose 
             	  of staying is to encourage more people to go to the Pure Land. 
             	  It is remarkable that we ourselves are able to go, but it would 
             	  be even better if we could help others to go there as well! 
             	  Thus, we can concentrate on helping, educating and encouraging 
             	  others. When we ourselves cultivate and encourage others to 
             	  cultivate as well, the merit is perfect. In so doing, we are 
             	  able to pay back the great kindness that Buddhas and 
             	  Bodhisattvas have shown us. For the seeking to be effective, 
             	  there must be a gain. My name used to be Xue-Hai, which means 
             	  &#8220;broad learning&#8221;, but after receiving these teachings from 
             	  Master Yun-Gu, I changed it to Liao-Fan, which means, 
             	  &#8220;transcending the ordinary&#8221;. In the past, people had three sets 
             	  of names (in China); their formal name, courtesy name and 
             	  assumed name. Their parents gave the first one. This name could 
             	  not be changed for to do so would have been unfilial. The names 
             	  that parents gave expressed their aspirations for their 
             	  children. If these were changed, it was tantamount to ignoring 
             	  this aspiration, truly an unfilial act. Their assumed name was 
             	  sometimes used when one had a certain social status or prestige 
             	  in society. When people reached adulthood, others no longer 
             	  called him or her by the name that had been given by the 
             	  parents. Upon reaching age twenty, males underwent a ceremony to 
             	  be initiated into adulthood. Before this ceremony, everyone 
             	  could address him by his given name. Moreover, after this it was 
             	  disrespectful for others to still address him by the name given 
             	  by the parents. Then how did others address him' During the 
             	  ceremony, people of the same generation or older, siblings, 
             	  schoolmates and friends would give the courtesy name. For the 
             	  rest of his life, he was addressed by this name but not by the 
             	  formal name. If in the future, he were to become a government 
             	  official or even the emperor, people would address him by his 
             	  courtesy name. (The same applied to females, although their age 
             	  for reaching adulthood was sixteen years old.) If a person was 
             	  addressed by his formal name, then most likely he had committed 
             	  a crime, been sentenced and punished. We need to be clear on 
             	  this general knowledge of how people were addressed. If people 
             	  wanted to be even more respectful, they would address an 
             	  individual by an assumed name or by his or her birthplace. To 
             	  address a person as such indicated that he was a respected 
             	  important person from a particular place. To address a person by 
             	  his birthplace was the most respected form of address. It is the 
             	  same in Buddhism, to show the utmost respect, a monk or nun is 
             	  addressed by the name of his or her way place or location. 
             	  Master Zhi Zhe was addressed as the great master of Tiantai 
             	  because he lived on Tiantai Mountain. Another example is Master 
             	  Kui Ji who was called Ci En because he was from the Ci En 
             	  Temple. Liao-Fan and Xue-Hai were Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s assumed names, 
             	  a very respectful way of addressing him. Only the parents and 
             	  teacher used a person's formal name after that person reached 
             	  adulthood. Even grandparents, uncles and emperors still 
             	  addressed a person by the courtesy name. Thus, we see that 
             	  society accorded the same gratitude and respect to teachers as 
             	  it did to parents. It signified my understanding of the fact 
             	  that we could create our destiny and that I did not wish to be 
             	  like ordinary people, who were controlled by their destiny. From 
             	  then on, I began to be very cautious and careful in whatever I 
             	  thought or did. Soon I felt quite different from before. In the 
             	  past, I was careless and had no self-discipline at all. Now, I 
             	  found myself being naturally cautious and conscientious. This 
             	  segment talks of Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s determination and cultivation in 
             	  correcting his errors and making a new start. First, he changed 
             	  his assumed name to Liao-Fan from Xue-Hai. &#8220;Liao&#8221; means to 
             	  clearly understand. &#8220;Fan&#8221; means ordinary. At that moment, he 
             	  understood everything in regards to everyday matters. He was 
             	  awakened. He truly knew that only we could change and create 
             	  destiny. He understood the principles and methods, and knew that 
             	  from then on he did not have to just follow the path of destiny 
             	  because it was not fixed. After his resolution to reform, his 
             	  feeling in daily living changed. From that point on until the 
             	  end of his life he was constantly aware of his thoughts and 
             	  behavior, was always on the alert, no longer deluded. In the 
             	  past he had been unrestrained, doing things as he pleased, 
             	  drifting aimlessly through each day. How did he live his life' 
             	  He did not know. He had no direction, no goal. If we live this 
             	  way, we will be bound by fate, unable to create our own bright 
             	  future. After reforming, he found himself being naturally 
             	  cautious and careful in thought, speech and behavior. In other 
             	  words, after turning over new leaf, his beliefs differed, his 
             	  viewpoints regarding life and the universe changed dramatically. 
             	  Before, he thought everything was bound by fate. But now he knew 
             	  that he, we, each could create destiny. Thus, he was more 
             	  positive, more determined and optimistic. I maintained this 
             	  attitude even when alone, for I know that there are spirits and 
             	  heavenly beings everywhere who can know my every action and 
             	  thought. I am cautious to not offend them with my thoughts. Even 
             	  when I encounter people, who dislike or slander me, I could take 
             	  their insults with a patient and peaceful mind and do not feel 
             	  compelled to quarrel with them. The reason why ordinary people 
             	  cannot reform is that they do not understand this. Those who are 
             	  more familiar with the Infinite Life Sutra will understand such 
             	  situations and be even more careful with their thoughts, speech 
             	  and behavior than Mr. Liao-Fan was. This is because the 
             	  population of the Pure Land is beyond calculation. Even if we 
             	  used every computer in the world, we still could not calculate 
             	  the number of beings who live there. And yet every one of them 
             	  possesses the same abilities as those of Buddha Amitabha. Each 
             	  of them has the heavenly eye to see all, heavenly ears to hear 
             	  all, the ability to know every thought of every being throughout 
             	  the universe in the past, present and future. So, Buddha 
             	  Amitabha, Great Compassion Bodhisattva, Great Strength 
             	  Bodhisattva and all the beings in the Western Pure Land know our 
             	  every thought, our every wrongdoing. This talks of when we are 
             	  alone where no one else can see us. We still need to restrain 
             	  ourselves and not give rise to a single improper thought. In so 
             	  doing, we will truly achieve self-discipline and control. As 
             	  Pure Land practitioners, we want to seek birth into the Pure 
             	  Land, want to achieve our virtuous conduct. If we continue to 
             	  deceive ourselves, we will be unable to achieve. Confucius said, 
             	  &#8220;A decent person is cautious even when alone&#8221;. Even if we live 
             	  alone, we can still discipline ourselves by not indulging 
             	  ourselves without restrictions. In this way, we will truly be 
             	  cultivating. Ordinary people constantly indulge themselves 
             	  without any real discipline. When in public they may appear 
             	  careful and self-restrained, but when alone will again indulge 
             	  themselves. For example, why is it that way places of the past 
             	  had many practitioners sleeping in one room and did not allow 
             	  anyone to have a single room' Because if there was only one 
             	  person sleeping in a room, he or she would be unable to achieve 
             	  in cultivation. To sleep in a room with others is to rely on the 
             	  group. When there are over ten people sleeping in a room, they 
             	  will behave well even while sleeping. The purpose of this was to 
             	  force people to discipline themselves. Today&#8217;s society is 
             	  different from those of the past in that no one is willing to 
             	  restrain himself or herself, but are intent on enjoying comfort. 
             	  Fine! We can enjoy ourselves in this life and then we can 
             	  leisurely enjoy ourselves in the Three Bad Realms in the 
             	  upcoming life, not succeeding on the path to enlightenment. 
             	  Living with a large group, everyone needs to work together. 
             	  There are some single rooms at way places, but they are 
             	  especially for those cultivators of advanced years who have 
             	  mobility problems. Also, those who hold high position and who 
             	  have many responsibilities, like abbots, or the leading monk 
             	  also need to have a room of their own, for the convenience of 
             	  overseeing matters at all hours without disturbing others. 
             	  Therefore, true cultivators practice &#8220;living together 
             	  harmoniously&#8221;, one of the Six Principles of Harmony. It is 
             	  inappropriate for an individual to have a single room. If a 
             	  person thinks it is uncomfortable to have two or three people 
             	  living together in a room, it then becomes easy for them to 
             	  think, &#8220;I do not want to live with this or that particular 
             	  person&#8221;. Then he or she will not be able to achieve the state of 
             	  Constant Mindfulness of Buddha Amitabha. Why' They have 
             	  discriminatory and impure minds. The mind that still has 
             	  dislikes and evasions. How would that person achieve' Then where 
             	  and how do we cultivate' Wherever it is that we dislike the 
             	  most. Wherever exists the most discriminatory environment to 
             	  cultivate our purity, our non-discriminatory mind. It is wrong 
             	  for us to not be willing to live with or get along with someone. 
             	  Mr. Liao-Fan had discovered his faults, mended his ways and 
             	  sincerely corrected his errors. Now when we have this fault, 
             	  instead of correcting it, we continuously nurture it. How can we 
             	  hope to succeed in our cultivation' Therefore, within a Sangha, 
             	  a starting point for our cultivation is the Six Principles of 
             	  Harmony, which are the basic guidelines to follow when living 
             	  together in a large group. For individuals, everyone can abide 
             	  by the Five Fundamental Precepts and Ten Good Conducts. In the 
             	  past, way places used the Sami Precepts and guidelines for 
             	  dignified behavior as the standard. It includes the Ten precepts 
             	  and twenty-four kinds of dignified manners. Today, we do not 
             	  need to be that strict. It would suffice for us to follow the 
             	  Five Precepts and the Ten Good Conducts as the standard for both 
             	  lay people and for monks and nuns. However, the standard cannot 
             	  be lower than this. To live in a group it is necessary to abide 
             	  by the Six Principles of Harmony to correct our faults and bad 
             	  habits and to learn to neither dislike nor detest others. Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan found that now he did not mind even when he encountered 
             	         	  those who disliked or even slandered him. Rather, he found that 
             	  he could patiently bear their insults with a peaceful mind and 
             	  no longer felt compelled to quarrel with them. It was evident 
             	  that his state of mind was calm and serene, unlike before, when 
             	  he was flighty and impatient, unable to endure the slightest 
             	  inconvenience or wrong. Here we can see his improvement from 
             	  cultivation. Therefore, a true Buddhist practitioner needs to 
             	  learn how to get along with everybody whether they are Buddhas 
             	  and Bodhisattvas or even demons and ghosts, we need to find our 
             	  inner peace and to hold on to it, regardless of the current 
             	  environment or circumstances. After the Sixth Patriarch of Zen 
             	  Master Hui-Neng was enlightened, he found himself in the 
             	  presence of and thus, attendant to a group of hunters. He 
             	  witnessed their hunting, killing and committing many bad deeds 
             	  daily. Also, he cooked their meat for them and took care of 
             	  them. At that time, the hunters were his masters. He was their 
             	  servant. He did this not for just a short time, but for fifteen 
             	  years. Could we have endured doing this' He not only endured but 
             	  lived in ease in that environment, not giving rise to wandering 
             	  thoughts, discriminatory thoughts and attachments. These were 
             	  fifteen years of his true cultivation. He reached enlightenment 
             	  when he was in Huangmei, in the southern part of China. Having 
             	  attained enlightenment, he then started to correct his bad 
             	  habits. Whether under favorable or adverse circumstances, he 
             	  cultivated his mind of purity, equality, great compassion and 
             	  kindness. There is nothing more important than the cultivation 
             	  of these four qualities. Today, when we interact with people, 
             	  matters and objects, are we cultivating our purity of mind under 
             	  favorable or adverse conditions' If we are not cultivating our 
             	  purity of mind, then we are not really cultivating and will not 
             	  attain any benefit. If so, we are not properly practicing 
             	  Buddhism, then we are studying it as an academic pursuit. Even 
             	  if we spent everyday reading the sutras and were extremely 
             	  articulate in explaining them, we would just be increasing our 
             	  afflictions. In this way, we will be in the Three Bad Realms. 
             	  This is absolutely wrong! True practitioners do not attach to 
             	  the words, do not attach to what has been said, to what has been 
             	  specified and thought, rather they use their intuition. They 
             	  seek purity of mind, the non-discriminatory mind and the true 
             	  mind, which is our original self-nature. They seek perfect 
             	  complete enlightenment. As Pure Land practitioners, this is also 
             	  our goal, to attain Constant Mindfulness of Buddha Amitabha. 
             	  Constant mindfulness is the mind of purity and equality. 
             	  Non-discrimination is one entirety. Purity is one entirety. 
             	  There is no barrier within the true mind. In other words, if we 
             	  still have discriminatory thoughts and attachments, then we are 
             	  unable to achieve constant mindfulness. Departing from these 
             	  discriminatory thoughts and attachments, we will be able to 
             	  achieve constant mindfulness, to be truly cultivating. Although 
             	  this is not a very high level of achievement, attaining it shows 
             	  that Mr. Liao-Fan was proceeding correctly and had received a 
             	  good response. The year after I met Master Yun-Gu, I took the 
             	  preliminary imperial examination in which Mr. Kong had predicted 
             	  that I would come in third place. Amazingly, I came in first! 
             	  Mr. Kong&#8217;s predictions were beginning to lose their accuracy. He 
             	  had not predicted that I would pass the imperial examination at 
             	  all, but that autumn, I did! Mr. Liao-Fan was destined to place 
             	  third in the examination. But by cultivating kind deeds and 
             	  accumulating merits and virtue, he was able to improve his 
             	  placement from third to first. As Mr. Kong&#8217;s predictions began 
             	  to lose their accuracy Mr. Liao-Fan saw first hand that he was 
             	  able to change destiny, saw first hand that there were variables 
             	  and not just constants. Next, he made the wish to pass an even 
             	  higher level of examination and again his wish came true. To 
             	  gain something we were not destined to have is to truly have 
             	  sought and gained. Although I had corrected many of my faults, I 
             	  found that I could not wholeheartedly do the things I ought to. 
             	  Even if I did do them, it was forced and unnatural. I reflected 
             	  within and found that I still had many shortcomings. Such as 
             	  seeing an opportunity to practice kindness and not being eager 
             	  enough to do it or having doubts when helping others in need. 
             	  Sometimes I forced myself to act kindly, but my speech was still 
             	  untamed and offensive. I found I could contain myself when 
             	  sober, but after a few drinks, I would lose self-discipline and 
             	  act without restraint. Although I often practiced kind deeds and 
             	  accumulated merits, my faults and offenses were so numerous, 
             	  they seemed to outnumber my good deeds. A lot of my time was 
             	  spent vainly and without value. We would do well to pay 
             	  attention to these several points. We should not expect any 
             	  reward when we help others, for it is our responsibility to do 
             	  so. Confucius and other sages taught us the five human 
             	  relationships and ten moral responsibilities. The five human 
             	  relationships are founded on traditional moral principles. They 
             	  include those between husband and wife, parent and child, 
             	  siblings, friends, political leaders and the public. To practice 
             	  what we ought to practice is a virtue of our nature. It is 
             	  naturally within our responsibility as parents to be protective, 
             	  to care for and guide our children. It is naturally within our 
             	  responsibility as children to be filial, to honor and respect 
             	  our parents. Whether as siblings or friends, all should be 
             	  respectful towards one another. Friends should be trustworthy, 
             	  honest and reliable. We are naturally obligated to be so. All of 
             	  us should be mutually caring, respectful and helpful with each 
             	  other. Mr. Liao-Fan understood this, although he did not yet 
             	  practice them perfectly and purely, for these were still 
             	  intermingled with personal advantages and disadvantages. If I 
             	  were to help this person, it would be harmful to me. If we have 
             	  these considerations, then our thoughts and actions are not pure 
             	  and we will be unable to wholeheartedly put our efforts into 
             	  helping others. From this, we know that although we do kind 
             	  deeds, we still have not yet done enough. Confucius taught of 
             	  the virtue in &#8220;assisting others in achieving goodness&#8221;. He 
             	  taught that goodness is a virtue. When we encounter others doing 
             	  good deeds, we would do well to help them to accomplish their 
             	  goal. Why' A good deed can benefit the whole town, the whole 
             	  society. For example, when a road needs to be fixed and a person 
             	  volunteers to repair it. We need to wholeheartedly put our 
             	  efforts into assisting that person to accomplish this kind of 
             	  good deed and to benefit the people or society needs assistance 
             	  from all of us. Mr. Liao-Fan was able to go along in helping 
             	  others, but he could not do so wholeheartedly. He was only a 
             	  little bit willing. He still had doubts when helping others in 
             	  need. If others are in trouble, we need to help them. But many 
             	  of us first question whether we should or should not. In today&#8217;s 
             	  society, we frequently encounter people asking for help. Some of 
             	  these people are frauds asking for money. After receiving it, 
             	  they go out and spend it on overindulging themselves in food, 
             	  drinks, women and gambling. If so, then our kind deeds become 
             	  transgressions. Thus, it is difficult indeed to do good deeds 
             	  for it requires both compassion and wisdom. Compassion is the 
             	  authentic driving force behind our helping. Wisdom will help us 
             	  to examine and judge whether we should help or not. If the 
             	  person does indeed need help, then we should do everything we 
             	  can to assist. On the other hand, if they try to cheat and 
             	  swindle us and we know what they are doing we need to guide 
             	  them. If they are not really old or ill, but are healthy and 
             	  strong then we can encourage and guide them to engage in a 
             	  decent and proper job, not to be making a living using devious 
             	  means. Therefore, correcting errors to make a fresh start is not 
             	  something readily accomplished, but requires time and continuous 
             	  reformation. In the beginning stages, difficulties are 
             	  unavoidable. To behave kindly and courteously in manner, while 
             	  being careless and thoughtless in speech is a habit. Since 
             	  ancient times, speech has been considered the source of both 
             	  fortune and misfortune, so we need to be constantly aware in our 
             	  speech. Of Confucius&#8217; four studies, the first one is that of 
             	  virtuous conduct, which is basic to how we conduct ourselves. 
             	  Today we would call this moral education. However, this kind of 
             	  education no longer exists in our society, as people today are 
             	  less concerned about it. The second academic discipline is 
             	  speech. Confucius was emphatic on the training of speech, that 
             	  we should speak properly with respect and not harm others with 
             	  our inconsiderate words. We often carelessly harm others with 
             	  our speech. When this happens, some may take offense and bear a 
             	  grudge. Then in the future they will in turn seek revenge. Thus, 
             	  much resentment and misunderstanding arises from this, creating 
             	  many problems for us. &#8220;The speaker had no such intention, the 
             	  listener interpreted it to be so&#8221;. Thus, we need to be discreet, 
             	  reserved and reticent in our speech. There really is no need to 
             	  talk a lot. In talking less, we will commit fewer mistakes. For 
             	  our self-achievement while encouraging others to achieve as 
             	  well, especially for practitioners cultivating purity of mind, 
             	  one phrase of &#8220;Amituofo&#8221; will suffice. In this way, when we find 
             	  ourselves subjected to hearing gossip, we would not respond with 
             	  anything at all but &#8220;Amituofo&#8221;. If they gossip more, then again 
             	  say &#8220;Amituofo&#8221;. Let them hear &#8220;Amituofo&#8221; several times. After 
             	  they are finished talking, we will not have paid attention to 
             	  anything they said. We will only have chanted &#8220;Amituofo&#8221; to them 
             	  and forgotten whatever they were talking about. This will be 
             	  good for it is best not to say much. Mr. Liao-Fan had the bad 
             	  habit of talking too much. The restriction on intoxicants is one 
             	  of the five major precepts in Buddhism. We need to understand 
             	  exactly why the Buddha prohibited alcohol intake. When 
             	  intoxicated we act foolishly and recklessly. If we can drink a 
             	  moderate amount of alcohol and not become intoxicated, then 
             	  there is an exception to this precept. However, the precept is 
             	  very clear on this, we are not even supposed to take one drop of 
             	  alcohol. Why' There was the fear that we would be unable to 
             	  control ourselves, which would lead to creating other problems, 
             	  breaking other fundamental precepts. In the past when I was 
             	  studying in Taizhong, my late teacher, Mr. Bing-Nan Lee lectured 
             	  on the Book of Rites. There was a commentary on the Book of 
             	  Rites written by Mr. Kang-Cheng Zheng, a learned scholar who 
             	  combined profundity with virtue during the East Han Dynasty 
             	  (almost two thousand years ago). He was a student of Mr. Rong Ma 
             	  who in his own time was also an exceptional scholar. However, 
             	  being narrow-minded, Mr. Ma would become extremely displeased if 
             	  any of his students&#8217; achievements surpassed his. Mr. Zheng&#8217;s 
             	  achievement did precisely this. Mr. Rong Ma could not only not 
             	  resign himself to the fact, so he hired someone to kill Mr. 
             	  Zheng! When Mr. Zheng was taking leave from his teacher, the 
             	  latter took his students to a pavilion ten kilometers out of 
             	  town to see Mr. Zheng off. He implemented his ill-intentioned 
             	  plan and began encouraging everyone to start drinking toasts. 
             	  Eventually, Mr. Zheng drank three hundred toasts! Mr. Rong Ma 
             	  had hoped to get Mr. Zheng drunk, which would have made it much 
             	  easier for the killer to succeed. He had no idea that alcohol 
             	  had no effect on Mr. Zheng who maintained his demeanor of 
             	  courtesy and propriety throughout. Mr. Lee said that if everyone 
             	  were able to drink this much without being affected like Mr. 
             	  Zheng, then Buddha Shakyamuni would never have needed to 
             	  establish this precept. We need to understand why Buddha 
             	  Shakyamuni set up this as well as other precepts. When lay 
             	  Buddhist practitioners are cooking, it is all right to use 
             	  cooking wine, because we will not become intoxicated. It is 
             	  therefore permissible to use it for flavoring. Alcohol can 
             	  improve poor blood circulation, so it is permissible for the 
             	  elderly to drink a glass at mealtimes. These are simply 
             	  exceptions to the rule. They are not breaking the precepts. 
             	  Similarly, there are five pungent vegetables of onion, garlic, 
             	  chives, green onions and leeks. Buddhists are discouraged from 
             	  consuming these, especially garlic. Why did the Buddha prohibit 
             	  us from eating these' The Surangama Sutra explains that purity 
             	  of mind is most important in our cultivation. However, if we 
             	  have not reached a certain level of achievement, our intake of 
             	  food and drink can adversely effect our mind. Once we have 
             	  achieved a certain level and are master of our mind, able to 
             	  change our environment according to our mind then there will be 
             	  no hindrances. But until then, if the environment influences our 
             	  mind so we are not in control of it, there will be obstacles. 
             	  The Buddha told us that when we eat these five pungent 
             	  vegetables raw, it increases our irritability. To eat them 
             	  cooked, can increase our hormone production, increasing our 
             	  sexual urges. So, there are reasons why the Buddha set up these 
             	  precepts. In other words, whether eaten raw or cooked, they are 
             	  forbidden because they increase our afflictions. Some lay 
             	  persons have said, &#8220;If we cannot eat these five vegetables, then 
             	  we are not interested in becoming vegetarian&#8221;. We need to 
             	  understand the purpose behind this prohibition. If these 
             	  vegetables are used as seasonings, if we stir fry one or two 
             	  cloves of garlic into a dish, it will not cause any harm. Thus, 
             	  when we understand the reasoning, we will see that Buddhism is 
             	  very logical, flexible and sensible. There are exceptions to 
             	  strictly observing the precepts even after we have received 
             	  them. These exceptions enable us to introduce Buddhism to others 
             	  and to get along happily with everyone. Therefore, at certain 
             	  functions, we need to behave wisely, to adapt ourselves to the 
             	  circumstance. Because it is an unimaginably rare opportunity for 
             	  them to encounter the teachings, we can make use of the 
             	  opportunity in introducing the teachings to others. During 
             	  drinks and at mealtime, we can explain to them the great truths 
             	  of Buddhism, to plant the good root. This is a rare educational 
             	  opportunity not to be wasted. It took me more than ten years to 
             	  complete the three thousand meritorious deeds I had vowed to do. 
             	  I was unable to dedicate the merits from these three thousand 
             	  good deeds at a temple until I returned to my hometown in the 
             	  south, a few years later. At that time, I had the opportunity to 
             	  ask two monks to dedicate them for me. Because Mr. Liao-Fan had 
             	  a post with the army that required constant travelling, he did 
             	  not have a chance to dedicate the merits. It was not until the 
             	  year after he fulfilled his pledge of three thousand good deeds 
             	  that he had the chance to do so. He engaged the services of 
             	  several monks at a temple to dedicate the merits on his behalf 
             	  after having completely fulfilled his pledge. When he had made 
             	  his pledge he had written to gods or to spirits and expressed 
             	  his sincerity and earnestness in turning over a new leaf and in 
             	  accumulating merits and virtues. Upon completion of his three 
             	  thousand virtuous deeds, he dedicated them to repay an 
             	  obligation and for the fulfillment of his wish. Then I made my 
             	  second wish and that was for a son. I vowed to complete another 
             	  three thousand good deeds. A few years later, your mother gave 
             	  birth to you and named you Tian-Qi. Mr. Liao-Fan had not been 
             	  destined to have a son, but having wished for one, found his 
             	  wish was fulfilled. &#8220;Proper seeking will enhance the gain&#8221;. He 
             	  attained his wish due to correct seeking and cultivation. Before 
             	  he had completed the second three thousand good deeds, his wife 
             	  had given birth to their first son Tian-Qi. From this, we can 
             	  see that if we truly make the wish, it will come true. Of 
             	  course, although he had gained a son before completing his 
             	  pledge of the three thousand good deeds, he would honor it. It 
             	  was the same as what had happened previously. He took the 
             	  imperial examination, but before he could fulfill his pledge, he 
             	  came in first when he had been destined to come in third. This 
             	  is to be in correspondence and is truly inconceivable. Every 
             	  time I performed a good deed, I would record it in a book. Your 
             	  mother, who could not read or write, would use a goose feather 
             	  dipped in ink and make a red circle on the calendar for every 
             	  good deed she did. Sometimes she gave food to the poor or bought 
             	  living creatures from the marketplace and freed them in the 
             	  wild. She recorded all of these with her circles on the 
             	  calendar. At times, she could accumulate more than ten red 
             	  circles in one day! Today if we have the heart to free captured 
             	  living creatures, we need to careful not to be deceived. Many 
             	  people who wanted to set creatures free would go to pet stores 
             	  to buy them. But these stores often captured the animals or 
             	  birds and then sold them for us to set free. If we did not buy 
             	  the animals, the stores would not try to capture more of them. 
             	  The more we try to free, the more they will try to capture. This 
             	  will not help animals but will put more of them at risk, causing 
             	  more harm than good. Then, instead of accumulating merits and 
             	  virtues, we accumulate offenses. Therefore, when we want to free 
             	  living creatures we need to do so only with those that we 
             	  inadvertently come upon when we go grocery shopping. Do not seek 
             	  them deliberately for to do so is to seek an affinity. By 
             	  happening to come upon one, we can determine if it will be able 
             	  to survive on its own. Otherwise, it would be best not to buy 
             	  it. It would be better to use the money to accomplish some other 
             	  merits and virtues. Therefore, we need to be wise in our actions 
             	  and not act impulsively or emotionally. The meaning of freeing 
             	  captured creatures does not just include setting animals or 
             	  birds free. It also includes becoming a vegetarian and 
             	  encouraging others not to kill living beings but to care for 
             	  them. For example, we can print and freely distribute copies of 
             	  the book the Love of Life with its beautiful illustrations by 
             	  Mr. Zi-Kai Feng, a famous Chinese painter. However, parts of 
             	  this book are in classical Chinese. If someone could update it 
             	  with colored illustrations and pronunciations for today's 
             	  readers, it could help more children to nurture their love for 
             	  living creatures. By doing so, we will truly achieve the essence 
             	  of freeing living creatures. We need to understand the spirit, 
             	  the profound meaning behind what we are taught not just follow 
             	  something to the letter. As for the practice of giving, there 
             	  are many kinds including the giving of wealth, teachings and 
             	  fearlessness. Each has its own inconceivably vast and profound 
             	  meanings. Both Mr. Liao-Fan and his wife had refrained from 
             	  wrongdoing and practiced good deeds. Obviously, they were 
             	  accomplishing their goal much faster than before. In the past, 
             	  they were sometimes unable to accomplish one good deed a day, 
             	  but took several days to do so. Thus, it took ten years to 
             	  complete the pledge of three thousand virtuous deeds. With three 
             	  thousand six hundred and fifty days in ten years, it is evident 
             	  that there were over six hundred days in which they failed to 
             	  complete any. But now they were able to accomplish more than ten 
             	  a day, a vast improvement over before. It is very difficult to 
             	  reform but they both had the perseverance and the patience to do 
             	  so. Without the willpower and the determination, it is not easy 
             	  to eradicate our bad habits and faults and this is the reason 
             	  why many of us regress more than we progress on the path to 
             	  enlightenment. Everyday we practiced like this and in four 
             	  years, the three thousand deeds were completed. Again, I invited 
             	  the same two masters to make the dedications, this time in our 
             	  home. On September thirteenth of that same year, I made my third 
             	  wish and that was to pass the highest level of the imperial 
             	  examination. I also vowed to complete ten thousand meritorious 
             	  deeds. After three years, I attained my wish and passed the 
             	  examination. I was also made the mayor of Baodi County. From 
             	  1580 to 1583, it only took Mr. Liao-Fan four years to complete 
             	  the second pledge of three thousand good deeds, whereas it had 
             	  taken over ten years to accomplish the first three thousand. 
             	  This time he again engaged the services of a monk to make the 
             	  dedication at his home. He had not been destined to pass this 
             	  particular examination. However, his destiny also had not 
             	  included having a son but he had attained one through his 
             	  seeking and practice. It would also be a variable if his wish to 
             	  pass the examination were to come true although he had not been 
             	  destined to pass it. Everything that Master Yun-Gu had taught 
             	  him had proved to be true. Now he pledged to complete ten 
             	  thousand good deeds. In 1586, only three years after his pledge, 
             	  as expected, he attained his wish in passing the examination. 
             	  After this, he was assigned by the imperial government to be the 
             	  mayor of Baodi County, a position that had not been in his 
             	  original destiny. Previously, he had been destined to be a mayor 
             	  of a county in Sichuan County, in southwest China, far from 
             	  Beijing. But now he was assigned to Baodi County, which was 
             	  close to Beijing, the capital. Then I prepared a small book to 
             	  record my merits and faults and called it the Book of 
             	  Cultivating the Mind. Every morning, when I started to work in 
             	  the office my servant would bring the book and have the guard 
             	  place it on my desk. I would record my every deed, good or bad, 
             	  no matter how small. At night I set an altar in the courtyard 
             	  and put on my official uniform to emulate the way of Mr. Zhao, 
             	  an officer in the Song Dynasty. I burned incense and reported 
             	  all my deeds to the heavens. This helps us to understand how he 
             	  felt about managing public affairs after he came into office, of 
             	  his wish to create good fortune for all those he was responsible 
             	  for. At this time, city or county mayors were chosen by the 
             	  imperial government, not elected. Mr. Liao-Fan was a very good 
             	  county mayor. He refrained from wrongdoing, cultivated good 
             	  deeds and accumulated merits and virtues. At the beginning of 
             	  his term of office, he prepared a blank notebook and named it 
             	  the Book of Cultivating the Mind. He used it every day to record 
             	  his good or bad deeds and thoughts, so that he could be watchful 
             	  over them to see when he would be able to fulfill his pledge of 
             	  ten thousand good deeds. Everyday Mr. Liao-Fan handled public 
             	  affairs and served as an interrogator in the judicial system. 
             	  This is unlike today where the judicial and legislative 
             	  departments are separated. In ancient China, the mayor managed 
             	  judicial and legislative cases. At night, in the manner of Mr. 
             	  Zhao, he then reported to the gods and spirits everything he had 
             	  done throughout the day, not hiding anything. Many ancient 
             	  people followed this practice. They would openly and honestly 
             	  admit to everything that they had done to be pure in body and 
             	  mind. Buddhists call this &#8220;confessing and apologizing to the 
             	  public&#8221;. Once, your mother was concerned when she saw that I had 
             	  not accumulated much merit. In the past, she was able to help me 
             	  in our accumulation of good deeds and we were able to complete 
             	  three thousand meritorious deeds. Now, I had made a vow to 
             	  complete ten thousand good deeds and there were fewer 
             	  opportunities to practice them at the government residence. She 
             	  worried about how long it would be before my vow could be 
             	  fulfilled. Before he became a government official, Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  was not as busy with work thus it was easy for his wife to 
             	  assist him in doing good deeds. As a government official, they 
             	  lived in a government residence. In the past, there was little 
             	  contact between those in the official residence and the public, 
             	  especially their family members. Therefore, she was no longer 
             	  able to help him in cultivating and accumulating good deeds. She 
             	  worried when they would be able to fulfill the pledge of ten 
             	  thousand good deeds. That night, after your mother spoke these 
             	  words, I dreamed of a heavenly being and told him of my 
             	  difficulty in completing the ten thousand good deeds. The 
             	  heavenly being told me that when I became mayor, I had reduced 
             	  the taxes on the farmlands. That was a great good deed and that 
             	  deed itself was worth ten thousand merits. My vow was already 
             	  fulfilled! As it turned out, the farmers in Baodi County had to 
             	  pay a very high tax and when I came to office, I reduced the 
             	  taxes on the farmlands by nearly half. But still, I felt strange 
             	  and bewildered. I still had doubts and wondered how a single 
             	  deed could be worth ten thousand merits. After he had become the 
             	  county mayor, Mr. Liao-Fan had reduced the tax on farmlands by 
             	  almost half. The amount of the decrease was substantial. Thus, 
             	  all the farmers in the county benefited from his act. Actually, 
             	  far more than ten thousand farmers in the county had benefited 
             	  thus this had easily fulfilled the pledge. However, he was 
             	  uncomfortable for two reasons. First, how had the heavenly being 
             	  known what he had done' Second, could this one act really be 
             	  worth so many merits and virtues' From this, we can see why it 
             	  is said that, &#8220;a position in the government is a good place to 
             	  accumulate merit and virtue&#8221;. Average people usually do not get 
             	  this kind of opportunity to cultivate such good fortune and 
             	  merit. If Mr. Liao-Fan had not become a county mayor, how many 
             	  years would it have taken him to complete the ten thousand good 
             	  deeds' At that time, he had the opportunity to be able to 
             	  benefit thousands of farmers with one deed because he held a 
             	  government office. Thus, his one good deed was equivalent to ten 
             	  thousand. It is easy to accumulate merits and just as easy to 
             	  commit wrongdoings. For if a public policy did not benefit the 
             	  populace, but proved to be harmful to them, then this act would 
             	  have become ten thousands offenses. Good fortune or misfortune 
             	  truly depends on our thoughts. The higher our position, the 
             	  greater the possibilities for creating good fortune or 
             	  misfortune. A leader of a country can implement one policy and 
             	  this good deed will prove beneficial to all citizens and 
             	  accomplish thousands, even millions of good deeds. On the other 
             	  hand, if the leader implemented a policy that proved harmful to 
             	  the public, then he or she would have committed thousands, even 
             	  millions of bad deeds. Average people do not have this kind of 
             	  opportunity. There is a limit to the extent of good or bad we 
             	  can do. If we hold the position and the status, and thus have 
             	  the opportunity, we would do well to be cautious in our every 
             	  action. By cultivating good deeds, we will have a bright future. 
             	  To do otherwise will ensure that we will fall into the Three Bad 
             	  Realms to suffer there. Why' The results from our actions are 
             	  more extensive and inclusive compared to those of average 
             	  citizens. Coincidentally, the Zen Master Huan-Yu was traveling 
             	  from Wutai Mountain and stopped in Baodi. I invited him to the 
             	  government residence, told him of my dream and asked whether it 
             	  was believable. Master Huan-Yu said, &#8220;If one does a good deed 
             	  with such a true and sincere heart without expectation of 
             	  reward, then one deed can indeed be worth the merits from ten 
             	  thousand good deeds. Besides, your act of reducing the taxes in 
             	  this county benefits more than ten thousand people. &#8221; Not long 
             	  after he had his dream, by chance he met the Zen Master Huan-Yu 
             	  from Wutai (Five Plateau) Mountain and asked him about what had 
             	  happened. He wanted to know if it was indeed possible. It would 
             	  be wonderful if something like this was true, that the pledge of 
             	  ten thousand good deeds was already completed! If it were not 
             	  true then he would gradually work to accomplish these deeds. 
             	  Master Huan-Yu then told him that yes, one deed done with the 
             	  heart of sincerity can be worth the merits from ten thousand 
             	  good deeds. This principle, &#8220;To cultivate one is to cultivate 
             	  all&#8221; was explained in the Flower Adornment Sutra. It is the 
             	  learning and cultivation of &#8220;non-hindrance&#8221;. Why' Everything 
             	  arises from our self-nature. If the cultivation corresponded 
             	  with the self-nature, then it can be regarded as cultivating 
             	  all. If we do good deeds that are not from our self-nature but 
             	  because we are seeking then we will only receive what we seek 
             	  and nothing more. If we seek from the self-nature then not only 
             	  will we attain what we seek but also we will gain infinite 
             	  benefits. What is the nature of the mind' An example, which is 
             	  easy to understand, is called purity of mind in the Pure Land 
             	  School. When our mind is pure, all of our deeds will be kind. 
             	  Thus, we will accumulate far more than just ten thousand good 
             	  deeds. &#8220;Amitabha&#8221; is a name of millions of virtues. As we 
             	  gradually come to understand the true reality, we will realize 
             	  that what Master Ou-Yi said was logical, that &#8220;Amitabha&#8221; 
             	  encompasses all the infinite ways of practice. He said, &#8220;How 
             	  would we know that if we were able to be mindful of Buddha 
             	  Amitabha then we would understand all the wisdom of the Great 
             	  Buddhist Canon. Also, we could attain awakening with the 
             	  guidance of the seventeen hundred stories of the Zen school&#8221;. 
             	  The practice of Zen Buddhism and the other schools all are 
             	  encompassed within &#8220;Amitabha&#8221;. Three thousand kinds of dignified 
             	  manners, eighty thousand minute courtesies and three divisions 
             	  of precepts are also within &#8220;Amitabha&#8221;. All the precepts, all 
             	  the Buddhist teachings, all worldly teachings are also included 
             	  within &#8220;Amitabha&#8221;. All methods, all ways of practice are within 
             	  this name for &#8220;One is all, all is one&#8221;. When we have achieved 
             	  purity of mind, then we will have perfectly achieved innumerable 
             	  methods. There are still many people who do not yet know the 
             	  infinite advantages found in the name &#8220;Amitabha&#8221;. When we give 
             	  rise to thoughts, all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and spirits of 
             	  heaven and earth know them. This one thought arises from our 
             	  true self-nature. The true mind has no limit, no boundary. When 
             	  we do even the slightest good deed, if it corresponds with the 
             	  true mind, then no matter how small, it is still infinite. Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan had yet to reach this state of mind. He had only 
             	  benefited the public in the phenomenal aspect. When we do a good 
             	  deed with a sincere heart, then this deed can indeed be worth 
             	  the merits of ten thousand. Master Huan-Yu told Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  that yes, his act of reducing the taxes in this county had 
             	  relieved the suffering of heavy taxes on all the farmers and had 
             	  benefited more than ten thousand people. However, Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  had yet to understand this, as his completion of the ten 
             	  thousand good deeds was done from the phenomenal aspect. If he 
             	  had done so from his self-nature, if he had cultivated from his 
             	  true mind, then that one good deed would not have been worth 
             	  just the merits of ten thousand good deeds but of innumerable 
             	  good deeds. If we see a beggar on the street and freely give him 
             	  one dollar, then the merit of this accords with our self-nature. 
             	  Why' Because at that time we did not have discriminatory 
             	  thoughts of others and we, of beggar and giver. We did not 
             	  differentiate between receiver and giver. We were not attached. 
             	  In this way, the merits from giving one dollar are infinite for 
             	  they are the uncovering of our virtuous nature. The merit from 
             	  giving millions of dollars may be less than that of one dollar 
             	  sincerely given. Why' We may have given this money from our 
             	  Eight Consciousness Minds. This mind has discriminatory thoughts 
             	  and attachments. It is limited and therefore, we are unable to 
             	  break through this obstruction. The reason why our merits cannot 
             	  compare with those of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is the 
             	  differences in our minds, in our intentions. The environment 
             	  changes according to our minds. We as ordinary people are very 
             	  narrow-minded, no matter how much good fortune or merit we 
             	  cultivate, we will always be bound by our discriminatory 
             	  thoughts and attachments. These thoughts and attachments no 
             	  longer bind Bodhisattvas and Arhats. Even when they perform a 
             	  small deed, their merits are infinite. In understanding this 
             	  principle, our every thought will be perfect and our merits and 
             	  virtues will be infinite. Mr. Liao-Fan could not yet even 
             	  imagine this state of mind. So, he practiced from the aspect of 
             	  phenomena and thus he benefited only ten thousand people. Upon 
             	  hearing his words, I immediately gave all my savings for him to 
             	  take back to the Wutai Mountain. I asked the Master to use the 
             	  money for a food offering for ten thousand monks and to dedicate 
             	  the merits for me. It was rare to see a person like Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  who would, without having to think it over, give his savings to 
             	  the Wutai Way Places to provide meals for ten thousand monks. 
             	  Usually, when laypeople wished to be generous they would provide 
             	  meals for one thousand monks or nuns, but Mr. Liao-Fan wanted to 
             	  do so for ten thousand, to fulfill his great vow of ten thousand 
             	  good deeds. Buddhism flourished during the Ming and Qing 
             	  Dynasties. There were several thousand monks and nuns who lived 
             	  on the four great Buddhist mountains in China. The ten thousand 
             	  who lived in Wutai (Five Plateau) Mountain was actually not an 
             	  especially large number. (Wutai Mountain symbolizes Great Wisdom 
             	  Bodhisattva.) The mountain with the most people was Putuo, 
             	  (symbolizing Great Compassion Bodhisattva) with around thirty to 
             	  forty thousand monks and nuns in residence. And there were over 
             	  ten thousand monks and nuns living on Emei and Jiuhua (Nine 
             	  Flower) Mountain, (symbolizing Great Conduct Bodhisattva and 
             	  Earth Treasure Bodhisattva respectively). Mr. Yu explained in 
             	  his commentary that &#8220;Someone who makes such a quick decision to 
             	  give generously, without the slightest thought of reluctance or 
             	  miserliness, will gain infinite good fortune in return&#8221;. This 
             	  generous giving without the slightest doubt showed that Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan was an honest official, not at all corrupt. He gave all 
             	  of his savings to provide food for ten thousand people. How much 
             	  money could he have' He came from a poor but honest family. And 
             	  he was very rare in that he deeply understood and believed in 
             	  the Law of Cause and Effect. He would never have taken anything 
             	  that was not his, something not readily achieved by most people. 
             	  While we do good deeds, most of us will only do the minimum. In 
             	  this case, we might give one hundred dollars to a good cause and 
             	  feel very pleased with ourselves for having done so, unlike Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan, who gave everything he had. A very rare person. Mr. 
             	  Kong had predicted that I would die at the age of fifty-three. 
             	  However, I survived that year without illnesses although I did 
             	  not ask the heavens for a longer life. Now I am sixty-nine. Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan was destined to die at the age of fifty-three. It was 
             	  an extremely accurate prediction. He would die in his home on 
             	  August 14th between one to three o&#8217;clock in the morning. It was 
             	  in this year that he would undergo a severe misfortune and not 
             	  live through it. Mr. Liao-Fan wrote his book at the age of 
             	  sixty-nine. He had not sought to live beyond fifty-three. 
             	  However, he passed the year in good health without encountering 
             	  any severe misfortune. It is obvious that the issue of birth and 
             	  death, of long life, is of utmost importance in our lives. If 
             	  long life can be sought, what is there that we cannot seek' 
             	  Without long life, it will be difficult to seek the attainment 
             	  and enjoyment of fame, wealth, prestige and children. This 
             	  seeking has to be done properly, in accordance with the 
             	  teachings, from our mind and heart of utmost sincerity. In this 
             	  way, there is nothing that cannot be attained. If we were seek 
             	  from the outside, then as Master Yun-Gu said, we would lose both 
             	  inside and outside. There is nothing that cannot be attained, 
             	  whether we are Buddhists seeking good fortune, wisdom and birth 
             	  into the Pure Land or the Chinese seeking good fortune, long 
             	  lives and children. Indeed, we can seek to attain more good 
             	  fortune, an even longer life, more children and grandchildren. 
             	  Nothing is unattainable. We have seen that Mr. Liao-Fan gained 
             	  good fortune, long life and children to totally surpass the 
             	  constant in his destiny. These were what he gained through 
             	  cultivation, not because they were destined. The Book of History 
             	  explains that &#8220;Destiny exists but is difficult to be believed by 
             	  most people because it is very changeable&#8221;. The Book of History 
             	  is one of the Five Classics. It is China&#8217;s oldest historical 
             	  record of the systems of decrees and regulations in ancient 
             	  times. Our destiny has been accurately foretold, falling within 
             	  the calculation of the numbers. The constant, predestination, 
             	  does exist, but it is very difficult to believe. Why' There are 
             	  variables due to addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
             	  division. Mr. Liao-Fan had refrained from committing wrongdoings 
             	  and began to cultivate good deeds, thereby decreasing his bad 
             	  deeds daily and gradually increasing his good ones. His act of 
             	  reducing taxes became an act of multiplication, no longer one of 
             	  simple addition. With this multiplication, ten thousand good 
             	  deeds were perfectly completed in a matter of days. If however, 
             	  he had done much evil, then in an instant, it would have become 
             	  an act of division no longer one of simple subtraction. 
             	  Therefore, there are indeed actions resulting in addition and 
             	  subtraction as well as those resulting in multiplication and 
             	  division that result from our thoughts and actions and it is 
             	  these that create considerable variance. There are constants, 
             	  but they are not fixed, they change. The Book of History 
             	  explains that destiny exists but is difficult to be believed by 
             	  most people because it is very changeable. The Treatise on 
             	  Response and Retribution further explains that &#8220;Neither 
             	  misfortune nor good fortune will come without reasons and 
             	  conditions, we incur them&#8221;. In other words, they are the 
             	  retributions and rewards from our past actions. &#8220;Destiny is not 
             	  set, but is only created and determined by ourselves&#8221;. These are 
             	  all true. This is also from the Book of History and stresses the 
             	  importance of virtuous cultivation, of how variables can surpass 
             	  constants. The teachings of ancient sages and virtuous ones are 
             	  the truth and therefore are unchangeable. Thus, then as now, we 
             	  call them &#8220;sutras&#8221;. When we apply the teachings to modern 
             	  society, they are still true. If we do not believe in them and 
             	  choose instead to continue to follow our own ideas and thus 
             	  commit wrongdoings, we will only increase our offenses. Even if 
             	  we were to gain some benefit at that moment, we would only gain 
             	  something that we were destined to have. If we do not know how 
             	  to cultivate virtues, then we will not be able to keep what we 
             	  attained. Not only can we not hold on to our wealth, we cannot 
             	  even hold on to our lives. And if we cannot hold on to our 
             	  lives, then what would be the use of having all that wealth' 
             	  This world may be beset with disasters anytime. We may lose our 
             	  lives any moment. Think about it, what would be the real value 
             	  of having anything else' It would all be useless, even if we had 
             	  owned them. It is clearly expressed in the &#8220;Chapter of Universal 
             	  Worthy Bodhisattva&#8217;s Conduct and Vows&#8221; from the Flower Adornment 
             	  Sutra. At the moment of our last breath, we are unable to take 
             	  anything with us to the next life, whether it is family members, 
             	  friends, prestige, wealth, nothing! What we are able to take 
             	  with us are the Ten Great Vows, to constantly keep them with us, 
             	  never abandoning us, but guiding us to be born into the Pure 
             	  Land. It is also said in Buddhism that &#8220;Nothing can be carried 
             	  over to the next life except our karma.&#8221; These are very 
             	  important words of caution. Since we know that our karma will 
             	  follow us like a shadow, we need to be diligent in cultivating 
             	  good deeds, not to carry our negative karma with us. For to do 
             	  so will lead us to the Three Bad Realms. Good karma will lead us 
             	  to be born into the Three Good Realms. And pure karma from 
             	  Constant Mindfulness of Buddha Amitabha will lead us to be born 
             	  into the Western Pure Land. From this, it should be clear what 
             	  we need to do in this life. We need to broaden our perception, 
             	  expand our thinking, instead of being concerned with 
             	  trivialities or calculating the gains and losses in this life. 
             	  Life is very short. It would be of tremendous merit, if in this 
             	  life we were to do more good acts, to benefit more people. If 
             	  after reading the teachings of ancient sages and virtuous 
             	  people, we are able to believe, accept and abide by them, then 
             	  we will receive inexhaustible merits and benefits. If we are 
             	  unable to believe in the teachings, thinking them unreliable 
             	  fairy tales, this is due to our karmic obstacles. Because of 
             	  them, we will miss this unsurpassable and outstanding 
             	  opportunity. To Teach Children to Know Their Faults, Reform, 
             	  Cultivate and Accumulate Merit and Good Fortune I came to 
             	  understand that both good fortune and misfortune are incurred by 
             	  our own actions. These are truly the words of sages and virtuous 
             	  people! If one were to say that good fortune and adversity are 
             	  all determined by the heavens, then I would consider that person 
             	  to be ordinary. These are Mr. Liao-Fan&#8217;s true words of 
             	  awakening. Great sages and virtuous people have true wisdom and 
             	  are able to clearly see the true reality. Buddhas and 
             	  Bodhisattvas are unsurpassed sages. This talks about a constant. 
             	  What Mr. Kong foretold of Mr. Liao-Fan's destiny was common 
             	  theories. What Master Yun-Gu taught him for changing his destiny 
             	  were the teachings of sages and virtuous people. Knowing this, 
             	  why would we need to have our fortune told' Do we need to ask 
             	  fortune-tellers how to situate our house' Of course not! We need 
             	  to believe in the teachings of sages and virtuous people, know 
             	  that our destiny is within our control and that we can create 
             	  our own bright and magnificent future. Tian-Qi, my son, I wonder 
             	  how your life will be' In any case of destiny we should always 
             	  prepare for the worst. Therefore, even in times of prosperity, 
             	  act as if you were not. When things are going your way, be 
             	  mindful of adversity. And when you have enough food and 
             	  clothing, be mindful of poverty. Mr. Liao-Fan had his destiny 
             	  accurately foretold. His son did not and thus did not know what 
             	  would happen in his life. In actuality, there really was no need 
             	  to know. Mr. Liao-Fan taught him that it was important to 
             	  remember that even in times of prosperity, he was to act as if 
             	  he was not prosperous. That even if he attained great wealth and 
             	  social position, became a high ranking official with power and 
             	  influence, he still needed to remember the times when he was 
             	  not. Why was there a need to remember this' Because in the 
             	  future, even if we become prosperous, we would do well to remain 
             	  humble and courteous, not giving rise to arrogant thoughts or a 
             	  haughty attitude that we have wealth and prestige while others 
             	  do not. If we can remain humble then we will nurture true virtue 
             	  and good fortune. Even when everything is going very smoothly, 
             	  we also need to remember when times were difficult. In this way, 
             	  even when things are going our way we will remain cautious and 
             	  not become careless. Ge-Liang Zhu was a famous Prime Minister 
             	  (in the Shu Han Period of the Three Kingdoms, seventeen hundred 
             	  years ago). He was able to remain successful throughout his life 
             	  because he was careful and discreet. Right now, even when we 
             	  have more than enough food and clothing, we need to be thrifty. 
             	  If we are able to constantly do this when we have wealth and 
             	  prestige, then we will be able to improve in both moral conduct 
             	  and benevolent behavior. A good example in Chinese history was 
             	  Mr. Zhong-Yan Fan. Mr. Fan was from a very poor family 
             	  background. When he was young and studying at way places, he had 
             	  little to eat. Everyday he would cook a pot of porridge, divide 
             	  it into four portions and eat one portion a meal. In this 
             	  manner, he passed the days in a state of impoverishment. When he 
             	  prospered later in life and became a Prime Minister (during the 
             	  Song Dynasty, eight hundred years ago), he was under the 
             	  supervision of the emperor and was in a higher position than 
             	  everyone else. But he still maintained his simple manner of 
             	  living and changed very little. When he earned more, he would 
             	  think of those who were poverty-stricken and used his earnings 
             	  to help them. By reading his biography, we know that he 
             	  supported over three hundred families. With the income of one 
             	  person helping to provide for three hundred families, we know 
             	  that he would also be living in impoverished conditions. If he 
             	  had lived affluently, how would he have been able to provide for 
             	  all those families' He was truly one of China&#8217;s great sages. The 
             	  esteem that Master Yin-Guang had for him was second only to 
             	  Confucius. Mr. Fan&#8217;s descendants continued until the early part 
             	  of this century. This is because he had fostered merits and 
             	  virtues to last over one hundred generations. The family of 
             	  Confucius is foremost as an old and well-known family, followed 
             	  by that of Mr. Zhong-Yan Fan. Mr. Fan&#8217;s family lineage remained 
             	  strong through eight hundred years due to his exceptional 
             	  cultivation and accumulation of merits. Great good fortune is 
             	  when we are able to share it with others for in this way our 
             	  ensuing good fortune will become inexhaustible. The descendants 
             	  of Mr. Fan continued this family tradition of helping others 
             	  until the early part of this century. Throughout Chinese 
             	  history, there were not many families who had accumulated this 
             	  much great virtue. In his commentary, Master Yin-Guang told of 
             	  another person, a Mr. Ye, the premier scholar of the Qing 
             	  Dynasty. His family lineage remained strong for three hundred 
             	  years, until the later years of the Qing Dynasty. It is thus 
             	  obvious that the utmost priority of life is for us to refrain 
             	  from wrongdoings, to cultivate good deeds and accumulate merits 
             	  and virtues. And when loved and respected by all, remain 
             	  careful, apprehensive and conservative. When the family is 
             	  greatly respected and revered, carry yourself humbly. When your 
             	  learning is extensive and profound, always think that the more 
             	  that you learn the less you feel that you know. We would do well 
             	  to avoid &#8220;Being overwhelmed by an unexpected favor&#8221;. It is good 
             	  for others to love and be protective towards us. However, we 
             	  need to think, what is it about us that is worthy of this love 
             	  and care' Is deserving of the respect of others' We need to be 
             	  constantly apprehensive of the deficiencies in our virtuous 
             	  abilities. It is good to think this way, to constantly reflect 
             	  upon ourselves, to progress in our cultivation of virtue and not 
             	  to disappoint the expectations of others. Being humble and 
             	  feeling that we are not knowledgeable enough are sufficient 
             	  methods for eradicating our arrogance. Arrogance is one of the 
             	  five major afflictions and is related to the other four 
             	  afflictions of greed, anger, ignorance and doubt. Indeed, this 
             	  was a very good place and a good way for him to start 
             	  eradicating afflictions. In doing so completely, we will be able 
             	  to uncover our virtuous nature, to truly achieve in our 
             	  cultivation of merit. When thinking of the past, we can advocate 
             	  the virtues of our ancestors. When thinking of the present, we 
             	  can conceal the faults of our own parents. When thinking of the 
             	  country, we can think of how we can repay its kindness to us and 
             	  when thinking of the family we can think of how to bring about 
             	  our families&#8217; good fortune. When thinking of the outside, think 
             	  of how to help those in need around us and when thinking of 
             	  within think of how to prevent improper thoughts and actions 
             	  from arising. The following summarizes this chapter, which is 
             	  very important for within it lies the key to creating destiny. 
             	  What we are thinking inside will be the guidelines for 
             	  increasing our virtue and morality and for developing good 
             	  deeds. In the past, Chinese education taught of the 
             	  relationships between humans, between humans and spirits, and 
             	  between humans and nature. It taught to be constantly thinking 
             	  far into the past, to honor and make known the virtues of our 
             	  ancestors. If we were respected by society for our moral 
             	  principles and ethics, knowledge and profession, we would honor 
             	  our ancestors. In today&#8217;s society, what is the driving force 
             	  behind hard work' Wealth, fame, prestige. Most people will do 
             	  whatever is necessary to acquire these. Why' The attainment of 
             	  wealth urges people, drives them forward. If there were no 
             	  wealth to gain, who would be willing to work so hard' Very few! 
             	  In the past, the driving force behind people&#8217;s hard work was 
             	  filial piety. In their mindfulness of their ancestors and 
             	  parents, they did their best in cultivating and accumulating 
             	  merits and virtues on their behalf and to honor them. This 
             	  driving force is much worthier and nobler than that of wealth, 
             	  fame and prestige. This has been the tradition of Chinese 
             	  culture and Confucian teaching for several thousands of years. 
             	  Buddhism is also based on the foundation of filial piety. Thus, 
             	  the ritual of making offerings to ancestors and the 
             	  establishment of ancestral memorial halls is highly regarded, as 
             	  it is the ultimate root and foundation of Chinese culture. If we 
             	  are able to be filial towards parents and ancestors, able to 
             	  remember our root, then we will naturally be able to think and 
             	  conduct ourselves properly and to refrain from wrongdoings. 
             	  &#8220;When we are thinking of the present, we can conceal the faults 
             	  of our own parents&#8221;. (This discusses those who are) close to us. 
             	  If the children are filial, have contributed to society then 
             	  even if their parents have committed minor offenses, people will 
             	  overlook and forget them. People will praise the parents for 
             	  having raised such filial children. &#8220;When thinking of the 
             	  country, we can think of how we can repay its kindness to us&#8221;. 
             	  Above us, the country or government has the mission of being a 
             	  responsible leader, parent and teacher to its citizens, of 
             	  providing a place where people can live and work in peace and 
             	  contentment. In return, the citizens should be loyal, patriotic 
             	  and dedicate themselves to their country. &#8220;When thinking of the 
             	  family, we can think of how to bring about our families' good 
             	  fortune&#8221;. Below us is the family. Being mindful of the family 
             	  does not just refer to the nuclear family, but to the extended 
             	  family as it was thought of in the past, the immediate family as 
             	  well as all relatives. As a member, we need to be mindful in 
             	  creating family good fortune for the whole, not just for the 
             	  immediate part. Therefore, when one person achieves good 
             	  fortune, the extended family can also benefit from it. &#8220;When 
             	  thinking of the outside, think of how to help those in need 
             	  around us&#8221;. Always bear in mind the interests of society. We 
             	  need to do all we can to serve society and to create good 
             	  fortune for all others. In today&#8217;s society, the most urgent need 
             	  is reviving and developing the education of morality and ethics. 
             	  &#8220;When thinking of within, think of how to prevent improper 
             	  thoughts and actions from arising&#8221;. We need to prevent wandering 
             	  and deviated thoughts from arising. We need to be mindful of 
             	  what we are supposed to be doing and to let go of excessive 
             	  ambitions. If all of us were able to do so, were able to fulfill 
             	  our responsibilities, society would be fortunate and harmonious 
             	  and the world would be at peace. Mencius explained that &#8220;If 
             	  people of noble character and integrity can be loyal to their 
             	  responsibility, then in this way the truth can be revealed&#8221;. In 
             	  Confucian teaching, this responsibility refers to the five human 
             	  relationships including those between husband and wife, parent 
             	  and child, siblings, friends, political leaders and the public. 
             	  He also spoke of the Ten Moral Responsibilities. All this means 
             	  that we need to fulfill our responsibilities towards society and 
             	  others. Whatever we have responsibility for, we need to 
             	  accomplish earnestly and diligently in order to create good 
             	  fortune for our family and society. One needs to be able to find 
             	  one&#8217;s faults everyday and to correct them everyday. If one is 
             	  unable to detect any faults in oneself then one will think that 
             	  everything he or she does is all right. Then, they will be 
             	  unable to correct their faults and improve-ment will be out of 
             	  the question. Awakening is being able to detect our faults 
             	  daily. It is the perfect complete enlightenment. The beginning 
             	  of enlightenment is to detect our faults daily. We start this 
             	  process when we first bring forth our vow to become an Equal 
             	  Enlightenment Bodhisattva. Once we discover our faults daily, we 
             	  need to correct them. This is cultivation. It is to correct our 
             	  thoughts and behavior daily. It is the true achievement in the 
             	  cultivation of great sages and virtuous people. This is the key 
             	  to changing our destiny, to leaving suffering behind and to 
             	  attaining happiness. When most people are unable to become 
             	  virtuous and sages in one lifetime and are unable to achieve in 
             	  their cultivation, they will find that the problem lies here. To 
             	  know our own faults daily is to awaken daily. Once we discover a 
             	  fault, we would do well to correct it. In this way, we will 
             	  build our strength of cultivation to sincerely reform. We gain 
             	  strength from our cultivation. We need not do much. If we were 
             	  to find and correct just one fault a day then we would become a 
             	  sage or a virtuous person in three years. As practitioners who 
             	  chant the Buddha&#8217;s name, if we are able to correct one fault 
             	  daily and be mindful of Buddha Amitabha then in three years time 
             	  we would achieve birth into either the high or middle birth 
             	  levels of the Pure Land. This is the way to cultivate to become 
             	  Buddhas. The question is whether we are willing to do so 
             	  earnestly. We are deluded if we are unable to daily find one 
             	  fault in ourselves. If we do not know them, then of course we 
             	  cannot correct them. How can we hope to improve in this way' 
             	  When there is no improvement, there is regression. Naturally, we 
             	  would then fall behind. To regard ourselves as infallible, to be 
             	  convinced that everything we do is correct is the most horrible 
             	  way for us to live. There are many intelligent people in the 
             	  world who cannot make improve-ments in cultivating morality and 
             	  virtue. Nor can they make improvements in their work. Their 
             	  failures in this life are owed to a single word. Laziness. If we 
             	  live for the present, are lethargic and lazy then we will be 
             	  bound by our fate. How we are born and die, where we will go 
             	  after we die all accords with our destinies. Master Yun-Gu 
             	  addressed people like this as ordinary people, as philistines 
             	  who completely follow what has been destined. They are what the 
             	  Buddha called &#8220;pitiful creatures&#8221;. These principles, which Mr. 
             	  Liao-Fan taught his son are the principles for both worldly 
             	  education as well as Buddhism and must not be ignored. Tian-Qi, 
             	  the teachings of Master Yun-Gu are truly the most worthy, 
             	  profound, real and proper teachings, and I hope that you will be 
             	  well-versed in them and practice them diligently. You must use 
             	  your time wisely and not let it slip by in vain. Mr. Liao-Fan 
             	  carefully wrote down the principles and methods that the Master 
             	  had taught him in changing his destiny and passed them on to his 
             	  son, hoping that he too would cultivate following this method. 
             	  Mr. Liao-Fan had received remarkable results from this practice 
             	  and thus firmly believed in all the principles and methods that 
             	  the master had taught. We need to be very familiar with Master 
             	  Yun-Gu&#8217;s teachings, to ponder them deeply to carefully 
             	  appreciate the meanings within. When we are constantly mindful 
             	  of the teachings, we will savor them, then use them as the basis 
             	  for our own behavior and practice them diligently. We should not 
             	  waste this lifetime or allow it to pass pointlessly</p>
