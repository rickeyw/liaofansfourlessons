      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <div class="contentarea">         
        <p>Liao-Fan's Four Lessons was originally written in the Ming 
          Dynasty of China by Mr. Liao-Fan Yuan. The book was intended to 
          teach his son, Tien-Chi Yuan, how to recognize the true face of 
          destiny, how to tell good from evil, and the method for correcting 
          one's faults and practicing kind deeds. It also provided living 
          proof of the rewards and outcomes of people who practiced kind 
          deeds and cultivated virtue and humility. Relating from his own 
          experience at changing destiny, Mr. Yuan himself was a living 
          embodiment of his teachings.</p>
        <p>After reading this wonderful book, one may feel more open and 
          confident towards life, and at the same time, courageously 
          compelled to follow the example of Liao-Fan in changing one's 
          original destiny. Liao-Fan's Four Lessons is truly a rare book 
          which is not only precious to an individual's spiritual needs, but 
          is also capable of transforming unhealthy attitudes in today's 
          society.</p>
        <p>Liafoan's Four lessons is divided into four chapters or 
          lessons. If one takes twenty minutes each day to read one lesson, 
          this book can be finished in four days. If one reads this book 
          continuoulsy for one year, they will be able to understand deeply 
          the meanings within.</p>

              <h4>Three Conditions for Reforming</h4>
              <div class="contentarea">
                <p>There are three ways to reform our faults.</p>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px">
                  <li>One must feel shame</li>
                  <li>One must know fear</li>
                  <li>One must have a determination and courage</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>First, we must be able to feel ashamed. Many ancient Chinese 
                  sages and virtuous people taught us that knowing shame is close 
                  to possessing courage. Confucius often spoke of great wisdom, 
                  great kindness and great courage. By knowing what is shame, we 
                  will truly reform and improve ourselves. if we do not know what 
                  shame is, we will not have good futures.</p>
                <p>Second, we must know fear. Constantly having this fearful 
                  mind will enable us to discipline ourselves so that we will no 
                  longer dare to commit wrongdoings. It will help us to be 
                  constantly apprehensive.</p>
                <p>Third, we need to be courageous in regretting and reforming. 
                  The first way to reform, which is to know shame, is close to 
                  being courageous. Having a sense of shame is to be deluded. 
                  Therefore, a sense of shame is a condition for awakening and 
                  courage is the condition for diligent cultivation. Feeling 
                  ashamed is awakening from within ourselves. Having a fearful 
                  heart is the external force that helps us to refrain from 
                  wrongdoing; this also reflects the deep shame in our true 
                  nature.</p>

              <h4>Three Methods of Practice in Reforming</h4>
              <div class="contentarea">
                <p>There are three methods of practice to help us reform.</p>
                <ul style="margin-left:20px">
                  <li>Changing through behavior</li>
                  <li>Changing through reasoning</li>
                  <li>Changing from the heart</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <p>For changing through behavior we can use an example; such as 
                  killing living beings in the past. I vow never to kill them 
                  again. If I used to get angry and yell at others in the past, I 
                  vow never to do so again. This is changing through behavior by 
                  refraining from repeating a wrongdoing committed in the past and
                  vowing never to do it again.</p>
                <p>Changing through reasoning begins by understanding why we 
                  should not do something; for example, killing. To love all 
                  living things is a virtue of heaven. To love all living things 
                  is a virtue of heaven. Understanding that all living beings love 
                  life and fear death, how can I be at peace with myself and fear 
                  death, how can I be at peace with myself by taking another's 
                  life to nurture my own? At times, animals such as fish or crabs 
                  have been cooked alive. Such pain and suffering reach down into 
                  their very bones. How can we be so cruel?</p>
                <p>What does changing from the heart mean? Although we have 
                  thousands of different faults, they ll stem from the heart, from 
                  the mind. We can correct our faults by beginning to change from 
                  our minds and practicing good deeds. If we practice from our 
                  minds, then even a small good deed such as unreservedly giving a 
                  penny to a person in need would be of infinite merits and 
                  virtues. Why? This deed comes from the great compassion in our 
                  true nature, thus the broadminded is boundless. The good fortune 
                  is infinite for the good deeds arises from our minds and accords 
                  arises with our true nature. However, if the good deed arises 
                  solely from our actions, then it is a small merit for it did not 
                  arise from our true nature.</p>
