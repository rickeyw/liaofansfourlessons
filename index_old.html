				<p>In the sixteenth century in China, Mr. Liao-Fan Yuan wrote Liao-Fan's 
				Four Lessons with the hope that it would teach his son, Tian-Qi 
				Yuan, how to understand true face of destiny, tell good from bad, 
				correct his faults and practice good deeds. It also provided living 
				proof of the benefits from practicing good deeds and cultivating 
				virtue and humility. In relating his own experience in changing 
				destiny, Mr. Liao-Fan Yuan was an embodiment of his teachings.</p>
				<p>The title of this book is Liao-Fan's Four Lessons. &quot;Liao&quot; 
				means understanding and awakening. &quot;Fan&quot; means that if 
				one is not a sage such as a Buddha, Bodhisattva or Arhat, then one 
				is an ordinary person. So, &quot;Liao-Fan&quot; means to understand 
				that it is not enough to be an ordinary person, we should be outstanding. 
				When unvirtuous thoughts arise, we need to gradually eliminate them.</p>
				<p>There are four lessons or chapters in this book. The first lesson 
				shows how to create destiny. The second lesson explains the ways 
				to reform. The third reveals the ways to cultivate goodness. And 
				the fourth discloses the benefits of the virtue of humility.</p>
				<p>This first lesson of learning to create destiny is a topic of 
				interest to many people who believe that wealth or poverty, long 
				life or short life, all is predestined. If someone had accomplished 
				good deeds in his or her past lives, then naturally in this life 
				he or she would live a wealthy and long life. On the other hand, 
				if someone had been a bad person and committed bad deeds in his 
				or her past life, then in this life he or she would live a poor 
				and short life. However, there are exceptions. Destiny can be changed.</p>
				<p>If we were originally destined to be rich with a long life, but 
				had committed excessive offenses, then without having to wait until 
				the next life to bear the consequences, we would become poor with 
				a short life. On the other hand, if we were originally destined 
				to be poor with a short life, but had accomplished exemplary deeds, 
				then without having to wait until the next life, we would become 
				wealthy with a long life. From ancient times until now, there have 
				been many examples of this in history. Although everything that 
				we are subjected to in this life is the result from our behavior 
				in our past lives and has already been predestined; it is not necessarily 
				constrained by destiny. We can still modify it with our current 
				behavior.</p>
				<p>Although Liao-Fan's Four Lessons is not a Buddhist sutra, we 
				need to respect and praise it as one. In the early part of this 
				century, Great Master Yin-Guang, the Thirteenth Patriarch of the 
				Pure Land School dedicated his whole life to its promotion and oversaw 
				the printing of millions of copies of it. Not only did he unceasingly 
				advocate this book but he also studied it, practiced what it taught 
				and lectured on it.</p>
				<p>As Buddhists, we are taught to refrain from all that is bad and 
				to do all that is good, to purify our minds. This is the Dharma 
				Seal, the criteria we can use to determine the genuineness of Buddhist 
				teachings or truths. Buddhist sutras, which speak of principles 
				and reasoning, are spoken by five types of people: Buddhas, in this 
				case Buddha Shakyamuni, his students, heavenly beings, immortals 
				and manifested beings.</p>
				<p>As long as what has been said has the same meaning and objectives 
				as those of the Teachings of the Buddhas and does not contradict 
				them, the Buddhas with their great broad-mindedness would recognize 
				them as sutras. Thus, we should regard and respect as a sutra, any 
				work that conforms to the principles in Buddhism. And this is especially 
				so for this book, which was certified and advocated by Great Master 
				Yin-Guang. It can help to serve as our foundation in learning Buddhism. 
				But even more important, it can also serve as a foundation for non-Buddhists 
				in helping them to learn how to change their destiny.</p>
				<p>There is much to learn about creating destiny, including principles 
				and methods, all of which are contained within this book. Small 
				in size, its impact can be far-reaching. Therefore, if we would 
				like to create our destiny or to truly achieve attainment through 
				the practice of Buddhism, we need to accord with the principles 
				and methods contained within it.</p>
